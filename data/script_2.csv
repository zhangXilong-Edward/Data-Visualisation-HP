Harry Potter ,"I can’t let you out, Hedwig. "
Harry Potter ,I’m not allowed to use magic outside of school. 
Harry Potter ,"Besides, if Uncle Vernon…"
VERNON,Harry Potter!
Harry Potter,Now you’ve done it.
PETUNIA,He’s in there. Vernon...
UNCLE VERNON,"I’m warning you, if you can’t control that bloody bird it’ll have to go."
Harry Potter,But she’s bored! 
Harry Potter,If I could only let out for an hour or two
VERNON,"Huh, huh! So you could send secret messages to you freaky little friends. No, sir!"
Harry Potter,But I haven’t had any messages from any of my friends... not one… all summer.
DUDLEY,Who’d want to be friends with you?
UNCLE VERNON,I should think you’d be a little more grateful. 
UNCLE VERNON,"We’ve raised you since you were a baby, given you the food off our table, even let you have Dudley’s second bedroom, purely out of the goodness of our hearts."
AUNT PETUNIA,"Not now, Pupkins. For when the Masons arrive."
UNCLE VERNON,Which should be any minute! 
UNCLE VERNON,"Ahem...Now let’s go over our schedule once again, shall we? "
UNCLE VERNON,Petunia when the Masons arrive you will be...?
AUNT PETUNIA,"in the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously into our home."
UNCLE VERNON,"Good! And- and Dudley, you will be...?"
DUDLEY,I’ll be waiting to open the door!
UNCLE VERNON,Excellent! ...And you...?
Harry Potter,"I’ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that I don’t exist."
UNCLE VERNON,"Too right, you will. "
UNCLE VERNON,"With any luck, this could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career. "
UNCLE VERNON,And you will not mess it up!
UNCLE VERNON,Mr. and Mrs. Mason! Do come in!
DOBBY,"Ha- ha- ha! Ha, ha! Ho, ho, ho! Ha, ha! "
DOBBY,Harry Potter! Such an honor it is!
Harry Potter,Who are you?
DOBBY,"Dobby sir, Dobby the house elf."
Harry Potter,"Not to be to be rude or anything, but this isn’t a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom."
DOBBY,"Oh, oh yes, sir! Dobby understands! "
DOBBY,"It’s just that, Dobby has come to tell you- it is difficult, sir"
DOBBY, Dobby wonders where to begin?
Harry Potter,Why don’t you sit down?
DOBBY,S-sit down? S-sit- sit down? 
DOBBY,"Oh, oh, ho. Oh, ho, ho... Oh, ho, ho."
Harry Potter,"Dobby, ssh! I’m sorry! "
Harry Potter,"I didn’t mean to offend you, or anything."
DOBBY,Offend Dobby? 
DOBBY,"Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal."
Harry Potter,You can’t have met many decent wizards then.
DOBBY,"No, I haven’t. "
DOBBY,That was an awful thing to say. 
DOBBY,Bad Dobby!
Harry Potter,"Stop, Dobby!"
DOBBY,Bad Dobby!
Harry Potter,"Dobby, shh!"
DOBBY,Baaad Dobby!
Harry Potter,"Dobby, please stop!"
UNCLE VERNON,"Ohh, don’t mind that! "
UNCLE VERNON,It’s just the cat.
DOBBY,Bad Dobby. 
DOBBY,Bad Dobby!
Harry Potter,"Stop! Stop, Dobby. "
Harry Potter,Please be quiet! 
Harry Potter,Are you all right?
DOBBY,"Dobby had to punish himself, sir. "
DOBBY,"Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir."
Harry Potter,Your family?
DOBBY,"The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. "
DOBBY,Dobby is bound to serve one family forever. 
DOBBY,If they ever knew Dobby was here...ooh... 
DOBBY,But Dobby had to come. 
DOBBY,Dobby has to protect Harry Potter- to warn him. 
DOBBY,Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year! 
DOBBY,"There is a plot, a plot to make most terrible things happen."
Harry Potter,What terrible things? 
Harry Potter,Who’s plotting them?
DOBBY,Ooo... er... can’t... say... argh...
Harry Potter,Ok– I- understand. You can’t- say.
DOBBY,"Don’t make me talk, I— Errr..."
Harry Potter,"Dobby! Dobby, put the lamp down."
DOBBY,Bad Dobby.
Harry Potter ,Give me the lamp! Dobby stop!
DOBBY ,Let me go!
Harry Potter ,"Get in there, and keep quiet!"
UNCLE VERNON ,What the devil are you doing up here?
Harry Potter ,I- I was just—
UNCLE VERNON ,You just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke!
Harry Potter ,Sorry.
UNCLE VERNON ,"One more sound, and you’ll wish you’d never been born, boy! "
UNCLE VERNON ,And fix that door!
Harry Potter ,"Yes, sir... See why I’ve got to go back? "
Harry Potter ,I don’t belong here. 
Harry Potter ,"I belong in your world, at Hogwarts. "
Harry Potter ,It’s the only place I’ve got friends!
DOBBY ,Friends who don’t even write to Harry Potter?
Harry Potter ,"Well, I expect they’ve... been- hang on- "
Harry Potter ,how do you know my friends haven’t been writing to me?
DOBBY ,Harry Potter mustn’t be angry with Dobby. 
DOBBY ,"Heh- Dobby hoped, if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him, Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir."
Harry Potter ,"Give me those, now!"
DOBBY ,No! Ahh! Ooh...
Harry Potter ,"Dobby, get back here!"
Harry Potter ,"Dobby, please, no!"
DOBBY ,Harry Potter must say he’s not going back to school!
Harry Potter ,I can’t. Hogwarts is my home!
DOBBY ,"Then, Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter’s own good. "
UNCLE VERNON ,"...it spread as far as the eye could see, all over the floor of this vast building, and it was this deep. "
UNCLE VERNON ,And one plumber said “Look at all that water.” 
UNCLE VERNON ,"A-and the second plumber said, “Yes, and that’s just the top of it!”"
UNCLE VERNON ,I’m so sorry! It’s my nephew- he’s very disturbed. 
UNCLE VERNON ,Meeting strangers upsets him. 
UNCLE VERNON ,That’s why I kept him upstairs!
UNCLE VERNON ,You’re never going back to that school. 
UNCLE VERNON ,You’re never going to see those freaky friends of yours again. Never!
Ron Weasley,"Hi, Harry!"
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley! Fred. George. 
Harry Potter,What are you all doing here?
Ron Weasley,"Rescuing you, of course. "
Ron Weasley,"Now, come on. Get your trunk!..."
Ron Weasley,You’d better stand back. Let’s go!
AUNT PETUNIA,Oh!
UNCLE VERNON,"Now, what the hell’s he doing? Potter!"
DUDLEY,Dad! What’s going on?
GEORGE,"Go, go, go, go!"
DUDLEY,"Dad, hurry up!"
Ron Weasley,Come on.

Harry Potter,Let go of me!
UNCLE VERNON,"Oh no, boy! You and that bloody pigeon aren’t going anywhere!"
Harry Potter,Get off!
Ron Weasley,Drive!
FRED,Right.
GEORGE ,Right!
UNCLE VERNON ,No! No! No! No! Aaaah!
AUNT PETUNIA & DUDLEY  ,Aaah!
DUDLEY ,Dad!
UNCLE VERNON ,Oh... Damn.
Ron Weasley ,"By the way, Harry, Happy Birthday!"
FRED ,"Come on. Okay, come on. Shh! "
FRED ,"Shh! Ok, come on. Shh! Come on."
Ron Weasley ,Do you think it’d be all right if we had some of this?
GEORGE ,"Yeah, Mum would never know."
Ron Weasley ,"It’s not much, but it’s home."
Harry Potter ,I think it’s brilliant
MRS. WEASLEY ,Where have you been? 
MRS. WEASLEY ,"Harry, how wonderful to see you dear. "
MRS. WEASLEY ,Beds empty! No note! Car gone!
MRS. WEASLEY ,You could have died! You could have been seen! 
MRS. WEASLEY ,"Of course, I don’t blame you, Harry dear."
Ron Weasley ,"They were starving him, Mum. "
Ron Weasley ,There were bars on his window!
MRS. WEASLEY ,"Well, you’d best hope that I don’t put bars on your window, Ron Weasleyald Weasley!  "
MRS. WEASLEY ,"Come on Harry, time for a spot of breakfast."
MRS. WEASLEY ,Here we are Harry. 
MRS. WEASLEY ,Now tuck in! That’s it. There we go.
GINNY ,"Mum- Mummy, have you seen my jumper?"
MRS. WEASLEY ,Yes dear. It was on the cat.
Harry Potter ,Hello. W-what did I do?
Ron Weasley ,Ginny. She’s been talking about you all summer.
Ron Weasley , A bit annoying really.
MR. WEASLEY,"Morning, Weasleys."
"FRED, GEORGE, Ron Weasley  ","Morning, Dad."
MRS. WEASLEY ,Morning Arthur!
MR. WEASLEY,What a night. Nine raids. Nine!
Harry Potter ,Raids?
Ron Weasley ,"Dad works in the Ministry of Magic, in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office. "
Ron Weasley ,"Dad loves Muggles, thinks they’re fascinating."
MR. WEASLEY,Well now. Aah! And who are you?
Harry Potter ,"Oh, sorry sir. I’m Harry, sir, Harry Potter."
MR. WEASLEY,Good Lord! Are you really? 
MR. WEASLEY,"Well, Ron Weasley’s told us all about you, of course."
MR. WEASLEY,When did he get here?
MRS. WEASLEY ,This morning. Your sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey and back last night.
MR. WEASLEY,Did you really? How’d it go? Did you—
"FRED, GEORGE, Ron Weasley, Harry Potter  ","Oh, it..."
MRS. WEASLEY ,Arthur!
MR. WEASLEY,"I mean...that was very wRon Weasleyg, indeed, boys. "
MR. WEASLEY,Very wRon Weasleyg of you
MR. WEASLEY,"Now, Harry, you must know all about Muggles. "
MR. WEASLEY,"Tell me, what exactly is the function of a rubber duck?"
Harry Potter ,"Oh, umm..."
MRS. WEASLEY ,"Well, that’ll be Errol with the post. "
MRS. WEASLEY ,"Oh, fetch it will you Percy, please?"
PERCY ,Errol...
Ron Weasley ,He’s always doing that.
PERCY ,"Oh look, it’s our Hogwarts letters. "
PERCY ,And they’ve sent us Harry’s as well.
MR. WEASLEY,"Dumbledore must know you’re here, Harry. "
MR. WEASLEY,"Doesn’t miss a trick, that man."
MRS. WEASLEY ,"Oh, no."
FRED ,"This lot won’t come cheap, Mum. "
FRED ,The spell books alone are very expensive.
MRS. WEASLEY ,We’ll manage. 
MRS. WEASLEY ,There’s only one place we’re going to get all of this. 
MRS. WEASLEY ,Diagon Alley.
MRS. WEASLEY ,Right.
MRS. WEASLEY ,"Here we are, Harry."
MRS. WEASLEY ,"You go first, dear."
Ron Weasley,"But Harry's never traveled by Floo powder before, Mum."
Harry Potter,Floo powder?
MRS. WEASLEY ,"You go first, Ron Weasley, so that Harry can see how it's done. Yes."
MRS. WEASLEY ,In you go.
MRS. WEASLEY ,That's it.
Ron Weasley,Diagon Alley.
MRS. WEASLEY ,"You see? It's quite easy, dear."
MRS. WEASLEY ,Don't be afraid. Come on.
MRS. WEASLEY ,Come on.
MRS. WEASLEY ,In you go. That's it.
MRS. WEASLEY ,Mind your head.
MRS. WEASLEY ,That's right.
MRS. WEASLEY ,"Now, take your Floo powder."
MRS. WEASLEY ,"That's it, very good."
MRS. WEASLEY ,"Now, don't forget to speak very, very clearly."
Harry Potter,Diagonally.
MRS. WEASLEY ,"What did he say, dear?"
MR. WEASLEY,Diagonally.
MRS. WEASLEY ,I thought he did.
MR. BORGIN,Mr. Malfoy! What a pleasure to see you again. 
MR. BORGIN,"If I may, just in today --"
LUCIUS MALFOY,"I'm not buying today, Mr. Borgin."
LUCIUS MALFOY,But selling.
MR. BORGIN, Selling?
LUCIUS MALFOY,"You have heard, of course, that the Ministry of Magic is conducting more raids. "
LUCIUS MALFOY,There are even rumors of a new Muggle Protection Act...
LUCIUS MALFOY,I have a few... ah... items at home that might prove embarrassing if the Ministry were to call.
LUCIUS MALFOY,Certain poisons and the like...
MR. BORGIN,Hmmm... yes. I see...
Draco Malfoy,Can I have this?
MR. BORGIN,"Ah, the Hand of Glory. "
MR. BORGIN,Insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder. 
MR. BORGIN,Best friend of thieves and plunderers. 
MR. BORGIN,"Your son has fine taste, sir."
LUCIUS MALFOY," Hopefully my son will amount to more than a thief, Mr. Borgin."
LUCIUS MALFOY,Though if his marks don't pick up --
Draco Malfoy, It's not my fault the teachers have favorites. 
Draco Malfoy,That Hermione Granger Granger --
LUCIUS MALFOY,I would have thought you'd be ashamed that a girl of no wizarding family beat you in every exam.
MR. BORGIN,It's the same all over. 
MR. BORGIN,Wizard blood is counting for less everywhere.
LUCIUS MALFOY,Not with me.
LUCIUS MALFOY ,Very good. 
LUCIUS MALFOY ,I'll expect you at the manor tomorrow. 
LUCIUS MALFOY ,"Come, Draco."
WITCH,"Not lost, are you, my dear?"
Harry Potter,"I'm fine, thank you. I was just going..."
WITCH,Come with us. 
WITCH,We'll help you find your way back.
Harry Potter, No. Please...
Rubeus Hagrid, Harry?
Harry Potter,Hagrid!
Rubeus Hagrid,What do you think you're doing down here? Come on.
Rubeus Hagrid,"You're a mess, Harry. "
Rubeus Hagrid,Skulking around Knockturn Alley? 
Rubeus Hagrid,Dodgy place.
Rubeus Hagrid,Don't want no one to see you there.
Rubeus Hagrid,People will think you're up to no good.
Harry Potter,"I was lost, I..."
Harry Potter,Hang on.
Harry Potter,What were you doing down there then?
Rubeus Hagrid,Me? I was... 
Rubeus Hagrid,I was looking for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.
Rubeus Hagrid,They're ruining all the school cabbages.
Hermione Granger,Harry. Hagrid.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Hello, Hermione Granger."
Hermione Granger,It's so good to see you.
Harry Potter,It's great to see you too.
Hermione Granger,What did you do to your glasses?
Hermione Granger,Oculus Reparo.
Harry Potter,I definitely need to remember that one.
Rubeus Hagrid,"You'll be all right now then, Harry?"
Rubeus Hagrid,Right. I'll leave you to it.
Hermione Granger,"Okay, bye."
Harry Potter,Thank you. Bye.
Hermione Granger,"Come on, everyone's been so worried."
MRS. WEASLEY ,Harry.
MRS. WEASLEY ,Thank goodness.
MRS. WEASLEY ,We'd hoped you'd only gone one grate too far.
MAN,"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart."
MRS. WEASLEY ,"Ohh, Here he is."
Ron Weasley,Mum fancies him.
PHOTOGRAPHER,"Make way there, please."
PHOTOGRAPHER,"Let me by, madam. Thank you."
PHOTOGRAPHER,"Excuse me, little girl."
PHOTOGRAPHER,This is for the Daily Prophet.
LOCKHART,It can't be. Harry Potter?
PHOTOGRAPHER,Harry Potter!
PHOTOGRAPHER,"Excuse me, madam."
LOCKHART,"Nice big smile, Harry."
LOCKHART,"Together, you and I rate the fRon Weasleyt page."
LOCKHART,"Ladies and gentlemen, what an extraordinary moment this is."
LOCKHART,"When young Harry stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning to purchase my autobiography, Magical Me…"
LOCKHART,"which, incidentally, is currently celebrating its 27th week atop the Daily Prophet bestseller list"
LOCKHART,"he had no idea that he would, in fact, be leaving with my entire collected works free of charge."
LOCKHART,"Now, ladies?"
MRS. WEASLEY ,"Harry, now you give me those, and I'll get them signed."
MRS. WEASLEY ,All of you wait outside.
MRS. WEASLEY ,That's it Ron Weasley.
Draco Malfoy,"I'll bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter?"
Draco Malfoy,Famous Harry Potter.
Draco Malfoy,Can't go into a bookshop without making the fRon Weasleyt page.
GINNY ,Leave him alone.
Draco Malfoy,"Look, Potter."
Draco Malfoy,You've got yourself a girlfriend.
LUCIUS MALFOY,"Now, now, Draco, play nicely."
LUCIUS MALFOY,Mr. Potter.
LUCIUS MALFOY,Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last.
LUCIUS MALFOY,Forgive me.
LUCIUS MALFOY,Your scar is legend.
LUCIUS MALFOY,"As, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you."
Harry Potter,Voldemort killed my parents.
Harry Potter,He was nothing more than a murderer.
LUCIUS MALFOY,You must be very brave to mention his name.
LUCIUS MALFOY,Or very foolish.
Hermione Granger,Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.
LUCIUS MALFOY,And you must be Miss Granger.
LUCIUS MALFOY,"Yes, Draco has told me all about you. "
LUCIUS MALFOY,And your parents.
LUCIUS MALFOY,"Muggles, aren't they?"
LUCIUS MALFOY,Let me see.
LUCIUS MALFOY,"Red hair, vacant expressions tatty, secondhand book."
LUCIUS MALFOY,You must be the Weasleys.
MR. WEASLEY,"Children, It's mad in here."
MR. WEASLEY,Let's go outside.
LUCIUS MALFOY,"Well, well, well. Weasley senior."
MR. WEASLEY,Lucius.
LUCIUS MALFOY,"Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur, all those extra raids?"
LUCIUS MALFOY,"I do hope they're paying you overtime but judging by the state of this, I'd say not."
LUCIUS MALFOY,What's the use in being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it?
MR. WEASLEY,"We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy."
LUCIUS MALFOY,Clearly.
LUCIUS MALFOY,Associating with Muggles.
LUCIUS MALFOY,And I thought your family could sink no lower.
LUCIUS MALFOY,I'll see you at work.
Draco Malfoy,See you at school.
MR. WEASLEY,"10:58, come on."
MRS. WEASLEY,The train will be leaving any moment.
MRS. WEASLEY,Oh dear! The train'll be leaving any moment! 
MR. WEASLEY,"Fred, George, Percy, you first."
MRS. WEASLEY,Okay.
MR. WEASLEY,"After you, dear."
MRS. WEASLEY,"Come on, Ginny, we'll get you a seat. Hurry."
Harry Potter,Let's go.
TRAINMASTER,What do you two think you're doing?
Harry Potter,Sorry.
Harry Potter,Lost control of the trolley.
Harry Potter,Why can't we get through?
Ron Weasley,I don't know.
Ron Weasley,The gateway has sealed itself for some reason.
Harry Potter,The train leaves at exactly 11:00.
Harry Potter,We've missed it.
Ron Weasley,"Harry, if we can't get through maybe Mum and Dad can't get back."
Harry Potter,Maybe we should just go and wait by the car.
Ron Weasley,The car.
Harry Potter,"Ron Weasley, I should tell you most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car."
Ron Weasley,"Aaa, Right."
Ron Weasley,"Oh, no! The Invisibility Booster must be faulty."
Harry Potter,"Come on, then. Let's go lower."
Harry Potter,We need to find the train.
Ron Weasley,Okay.
Harry Potter,All we need to do is catch up with the train.
Ron Weasley,We can't be far behind.
Harry Potter,Do you hear that?
Ron Weasley,We must be getting close.
Harry Potter,Hold on.
Harry Potter AND Ron Weasley,Aaaaaaahhhh!
Ron Weasley,Haaaarryyy!
Ron Weasley,Hold oonnn!!!
Ron Weasley,Take my hand!
Ron Weasley,Hold on!
Harry Potter,I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.
Harry Potter,I think we found the train.
Ron Weasley,Yeah.
Ron Weasley,Welcome home.
Harry Potter,Up! Up!
Ron Weasley,It's not working!
Harry Potter,"Up! Ron Weasley, mind that tree!"
Harry Potter AND Ron Weasley,Aaahhh! Aaah!
Ron Weasley,Stop! Stop! Stop!
Ron Weasley,My wand. Look at my wand.
Harry Potter,Be thankful it's not your neck.
Ron Weasley,What's happening?
Harry Potter,I don't know.
Harry Potter,"Come on, go! Fast!"
Ron Weasley,"Scabbers, you're okay."
Ron Weasley,The caaaar!
Ron Weasley,Dad's gonna kill me.
Harry Potter,"See you, Hedwig."
Harry Potter,So a house-elf shows up in my bedroom we can't get through the barrier to platform 93/4...
Harry Potter,we almost get killed by a tree...
Harry Potter,Clearly someone doesn't want me here this year.
FILCH,"Well, take a good look, lads."
FILCH,This night might well be the last you spend in this castle.
FILCH,"Oh, dear, we are in trouble."
Severus Snape,You were seen by no less than seven Muggles.
Severus Snape,Do you have any idea how serious this is?
Severus Snape,You have risked the exposure of our world.
Severus Snape,Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow.
Severus Snape,that's been on these grounds since before you were born.
Ron Weasley,"Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us."
Severus Snape,Silence.
Severus Snape,"I assure you that were you in Slytherin, and your fate rested with me... "
Severus Snape,the both of you would be on the train home tonight.
Severus Snape,As it is...
Albus Dumbledore,They are not.
Harry Potter,Professor Dumbledore.
Harry Potter,Professor McGonagall.
Severus Snape,Headmaster these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry.
FILCH,As such...
Albus Dumbledore,I am well aware of our bylaws having written quite a few of them myself.
Albus Dumbledore,"However, as head of Gryffindor house it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action."
Ron Weasley,"We'll go and get our stuff, then."
Minerva McGonagall,"What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?"
Ron Weasley,"You're going to expel us, aren't you?"
Minerva McGonagall,"Not today, Mr. Weasley but I must impress on both of you the seriousness of what you have done."
Minerva McGonagall,"I will be writing to your families tonight, and you will both receive detention."
PROFESSOR SPROUT,"Morning, everyone."
CLASS,"Good morning, everyone."
PROFESSOR SPROUT,"Good morning, Professor Sprout."
PROFESSOR SPROUT,"Welcome to Greenhouse Three, Second Years. "
PROFESSOR SPROUT,"Today, we will be re-potting Mandrakes. "
PROFESSOR SPROUT,"Now, who here can tell me the properties of the Mandrake? "
PROFESSOR SPROUT,"Yes, Miss Granger."
Hermione Granger,"Mandrake, or Mandragora is used to return those who have been Petrified to their original state."
Hermione Granger,It's also quite dangerous. 
Hermione Granger,The Mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.
PROFESSOR SPROUT,Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.
PROFESSOR SPROUT,As our Mandrakes are still only seedlings their cries won't kill you yet.
PROFESSOR SPROUT,"But they could knock you out for hours, which is why I have given you earmuffs for auditory protection."
PROFESSOR SPROUT,"So could you please put them on, right away? Quickly."
PROFESSOR SPROUT,"Flaps tight down, and watch me closely."
PROFESSOR SPROUT,You grasp your Mandrake firmly.
PROFESSOR SPROUT,You pull it sharply up out of the pot.
PROFESSOR SPROUT,Got it? And now you dunk it down into the other pot
PROFESSOR SPROUT,and pour a little sprinkling of soil to keep him warm.
PROFESSOR SPROUT,Longbottom's been neglecting his earmuffs.
SEAMUS,"No, ma'am, he's just fainted."
PROFESSOR SPROUT,"Yes, well, just leave him there."
PROFESSOR SPROUT,"Right, on we go."
PROFESSOR SPROUT,Plenty of pots to go around.
PROFESSOR SPROUT,Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up.
PENELOPE CLEARWATER,There's Nearly Headless Nick.
PERCY ,"Hello, Sir Nicolas."
SIR NICHOLAS,"Hello, Percy, Miss Clearwater."
Ron Weasley,Say it. I'm doomed.
Harry Potter,You're doomed.
COLIN,"Hi, Harry."
COLIN,I'm Colin Creevey. I'm in Gryffindor too.
Harry Potter,"Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you."
DEAN,"Ron Weasley, is that your owl?"
Ron Weasley,Bloody bird's a menace.
SEAMUS ,"Heads up, everyone. "
SEAMUS ,Weasley's gotten himself a Howler.
NEVILLE,"Go on, Ron Weasley. "
NEVILLE,I ignored one from my gran once. 
NEVILLE,It was horrible.
MRS. WEASLEY,Ron WeasleyALD WEASLEY! 
MRS. WEASLEY,HOW DARE YOU STEAL THAT CAR!
MRS. WEASLEY,I AM ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED! 
MRS. WEASLEY,YOUR FATHER'S NOW FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK AND IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT! 
MRS. WEASLEY,IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT HOME!
MRS. WEASLEY,"And, Ginny, dear, congratulations on making Gryffindor."
MRS. WEASLEY,Your father and I are so proud.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Let me introduce you to your new Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher. 
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"Me. Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League and five times winner of Witch Weekly's Most-Charming-Smile Award  "
GILDEROY LOCKHART,But I don't talk about that. 
GILDEROY LOCKHART,I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her!
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"Now, be warned."
GILDEROY LOCKHART,It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,I must ask you not to scream.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,It might provoke them.
SEAMUS,Cornish pixies?
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Freshly caught Cornish pixies.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan but pixies can be devilishly tricky little blighters."
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Let's see what you make of them.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"Come on now, round them up, round them up!"
GILDEROY LOCKHART,They're only pixies.
CORNISH PIXIES,You just stay there!
NEVILLE,"Please, get me down!"
Hermione Granger,Get off me!
Harry Potter,Stop. Hold still!
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Peskipiksi Pesternomi!
GILDEROY LOCKHART,I'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage.
Ron Weasley,What do we do now?
Hermione Granger,Immobulus!
NEVILLE,Why is it always me?
WOOD,I spent the summer devising a whole new Quidditch program.
WOOD,"We're gonna train earlier, harder and longer."
WOOD,What...? I don't believe it.
WOOD,"Where you think you're going, Flint?"
FLINT,Quidditch practice.
WOOD,I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
FLINT,"Easy, Wood. I've got a note."
Ron Weasley,I smell trouble.
WOOD,"I, Professor Severus Snape, do hereby give the Slytherin team permission to practice today, owing to the need to train their new Seeker."
WOOD,You've got a new Seeker. Who?
Harry Potter,Malfoy?
Draco Malfoy,That's right.
Draco Malfoy,And that's not all that's new this year.
Ron Weasley,Those are Nimbus 2001 s.
Ron Weasley,How did you get those?
FLINT,A gift from Draco's father.
Draco Malfoy,"You see, Weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best."
Hermione Granger,At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in.
Hermione Granger,They got in on pure talent.
Draco Malfoy,"No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood."
Ron Weasley,"You'll pay for that one, Malfoy."
Ron Weasley,Eat slugs!
Hermione Granger,"You okay, Ron Weasley?"
Hermione Granger,Say something.
COLIN,"Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?"
Harry Potter,"No, Colin, get out of the way."
Harry Potter,Let's take him to Hagrid's.
Harry Potter,He'll know what to do.
Rubeus Hagrid,This calls for a specialist's equipment.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Nothing to do but wait till it stops, I'm afraid."
Rubeus Hagrid,Okay.
Rubeus Hagrid,Better out than in.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Who was Ron Weasley trying to curse, anyway?"
Harry Potter,Malfoy. He called Hermione Granger...
Harry Potter,"Well, I don't know exactly what it means."
Hermione Granger,He called me a Mudblood.
Rubeus Hagrid,He did not.
Harry Potter,What's a Mudblood?
Hermione Granger,"It means ""dirty blood."
Hermione Granger,Mudblood's a foul name for someone who's Muggle-born.
Hermione Granger,Someone with non-magic parents.
Hermione Granger,Someone like me.
Hermione Granger,It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.
Rubeus Hagrid,"See, the thing is, Harry, there are some wizards, like the Malfoy family...who think they're better than everyone else because they're pure-blood."
Harry Potter,That's horrible.
Ron Weasley,It's disgusting.
Rubeus Hagrid,And it's codswallop to boot.
Rubeus Hagrid,Dirty blood.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Why, there isn't a wizard alive today that's not half-blood or less."
Rubeus Hagrid,"More to the point, they've yet to think of a spell that our Hermione Granger can't do."
Rubeus Hagrid,Come here.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Don't you think on it, Hermione Granger."
Rubeus Hagrid,Don't you think on it for one minute.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"Harry, Harry, Harry."
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Can you possibly imagine a better way to serve detention than by helping me to answer my fan mail?
Harry Potter,Not really.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"Fame is a fickle friend, Harry."
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Celebrity is as celebrity does.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Remember that.
VOICE,Come.
VOICE,Come to me.
Harry Potter,What?
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Sorry?
Harry Potter,That voice.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Voice?
Harry Potter,Didn't you hear it?
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"What are you talking about, Harry?"
GILDEROY LOCKHART,I think you're getting a bit drowsy.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"And great Scott, no wonder. "
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Look at the time.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,We've been here nearly four hours.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Spooky how the time flies when one is having fun.
Harry Potter,Spooky.
VOICE,Blood.
VOICE,I smell blood.
VOICE,Let me rip you.
VOICE,Let me kill you.
VOICE,Kill!
VOICE,Kill!
VOICE,Kill!
Hermione Granger,Harry!
Harry Potter,Did you hear it?
Ron Weasley,Hear what?
Harry Potter,That voice.
Hermione Granger,Voice? What voice?
Harry Potter,I heard it first in Lockhart's office.
Harry Potter,And then again just...
VOICE,It's time.
Harry Potter,It's moving.
Harry Potter,I think it's going to kill.
Ron Weasley,Kill?
Hermione Granger,"Harry, wait! Not so fast!"
Harry Potter,Strange.
Harry Potter,I've never seen spiders act like that.
Ron Weasley,I don't like spiders.
Ron Weasley,What's that?
Hermione Granger,"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. 
Enemies of the Heir, beware."
Hermione Granger,"Enemies of the Heir, beware."
Hermione Granger,It's written in blood.
Harry Potter,"Oh, no."
Harry Potter,It's Filch's cat.
Harry Potter,It's Mrs. Norris.
Draco Malfoy,"Enemies of the Heir, beware."
Draco Malfoy,"You'll be next, Mudbloods."
FILCH,What's going on here?
FILCH,"Go on. Make way, make way."
FILCH,Potter?
FILCH,What are you...?
FILCH,Mrs. Norris?
FILCH,You've murdered my cat.
Harry Potter,No. No.
FILCH,I'll kill you.
FILCH,I'll kill you!
Albus Dumbledore,Argus!
Albus Dumbledore,"Argus, I..."
Albus Dumbledore,Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately.
Albus Dumbledore,Everyone except you three.
BOY,"Ravenclaws, follow me."
Albus Dumbledore,"She's not dead, Argus."
Albus Dumbledore,She has been Petrified.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Aghh! Thought so.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,So unlucky I wasn't there.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,I know exactly the countercurse that could've spared her.
Albus Dumbledore,"But how she has been Petrified, I cannot say."
FILCH,Ask him.
FILCH,It's him that's done it.
FILCH,You saw what he wrote on the wall.
Harry Potter,"It's not true, sir. I swear."
Harry Potter,I never touched Mrs. Norris.
FILCH,Rubbish.
Severus Snape,"If I might, headmaster?"
Severus Snape,Perhaps Potter and his friends were just in the wRon Weasleyg place at the wRon Weasleyg time.
Severus Snape,However the circumstances are suspicious.
Severus Snape,"I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner."
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus."
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"You see, Harry was helping me answer my fan mail."
Hermione Granger,"That's why Ron Weasley and I went looking for him, professor."
Hermione Granger,We'd just found him when he said...
Severus Snape,"Yes, Miss Granger?"
Harry Potter,When I said I wasn't hungry.
Harry Potter,We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris.
Albus Dumbledore,"Innocent until proven guilty, Severus."
FILCH,My cat has been Petrified.
FILCH,I want to see some punishment!
Albus Dumbledore,"We will be able to cure her, Argus."
Albus Dumbledore,"As I understand it, Madam Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrake."
Albus Dumbledore,"When matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris."
Albus Dumbledore,And in the meantime I stRon Weasleygly recommend caution to all.
Hermione Granger,"It's a bit strange, isn't it?"
Harry Potter,Strange?
Hermione Granger,"You hear this voice, a voice only you can hear..."
Hermione Granger,and then Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified. It's just strange.
Harry Potter,Do you think I should have told them?
Harry Potter,"Dumbledore and the others, I mean?"
Ron Weasley,Are you mad?
Hermione Granger,"No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign."
PICTURE,"She's right, you know."
Minerva McGonagall,"Could I have your attention,please?"
Minerva McGonagall,"Right. Now, today, we will be transforming animals into water goblets."
Minerva McGonagall,Like so.
Minerva McGonagall,"One, two, three. Vera Verto."
Minerva McGonagall,Now it's your turn.
Minerva McGonagall,Who would like to go first?
Minerva McGonagall,"Ahh , Mr. Weasley."
Minerva McGonagall,"One, two, three. Vera Verto."
Ron Weasley,Vera Verto!
Minerva McGonagall,"That wand needs replacing, Mr. Weasley."
Minerva McGonagall,"Yes, Miss Granger?"
Hermione Granger,Professor I was wondering if you could tell us about the Chamber of Secrets.
Minerva McGonagall,Very well.
Minerva McGonagall,"You all know, of course that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age:"
Minerva McGonagall,"Godric Gryffindor,"
Minerva McGonagall,Helga Hufflepuff...
Minerva McGonagall,Rowena Ravenclaw
Minerva McGonagall,Salazar Slytherin.
Minerva McGonagall,"Now, three of the founders coexisted quite harmoniously."
Minerva McGonagall,One did not.
Ron Weasley,Three guesses who.
Minerva McGonagall,Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts.
Minerva McGonagall,He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families.
Minerva McGonagall,"In other words, pure-bloods."
Minerva McGonagall,"Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school."
Minerva McGonagall,"Now, according to legend Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle known as the Chamber of Secrets."
Minerva McGonagall,"Though, shortly before departing, he sealed it until that time when his own true Heir returned to the school."
Minerva McGonagall,"The Heir alone would be able to open the Chamber and unleash the horror within, and by so doing purge the school of all those who in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic."
Hermione Granger,Muggle-borns.
Minerva McGonagall,"Well , Naturally, the school has been searched many times."
Minerva McGonagall,No such chamber has been found.
Hermione Granger,Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?
Minerva McGonagall,The Chamber is said to be home to something that only the Heir of Slytherin can control.
Minerva McGonagall,It is said to be the home of a monster.
Ron Weasley,Do you think it's true?
Ron Weasley, Do you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?
Hermione Granger,Yes. Couldn't you tell? 
Hermione Granger,McGonagall's worried. 
Hermione Granger,All the teachers are.
Harry Potter,"If there really is a Chamber of Secrets, and it has been opened, that means... "
Hermione Granger,The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. 
Hermione Granger,"The question is, who is it?"
Ron Weasley,Let's think. 
Ron Weasley,Who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?
Hermione Granger,If you're talking about Malfoy...
Ron Weasley,Of course. You heard him.
Ron Weasley,"You'll be next, Mudbloods."
Hermione Granger,I heard him.
Hermione Granger,"But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?"
Harry Potter,"Maybe Ron Weasley's right, Hermione Granger."
Harry Potter,"I mean, look at his family."
Harry Potter,The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.
Ron Weasley,Crabbe and Goyle must know.
Ron Weasley,Maybe we could trick them into telling.
Hermione Granger,Even they aren't that thick.
Hermione Granger,But there might be another way.
Hermione Granger,"Mind you, it would be difficult."
Hermione Granger,Not to mention we'd be breaking about 50 school rules...
Hermione Granger,and it'll be dangerous.
Hermione Granger,Very dangerous.
Hermione Granger,Here it is.
Hermione Granger,The Polyjuice Potion.
Hermione Granger,"Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another."
Ron Weasley,"You mean if Harry and I drink that stuff, we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?"
Hermione Granger,Yes 
Ron Weasley,Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything.
Hermione Granger,Exactly.
Hermione Granger,But it's tricky. 
Hermione Granger,I've never seen a more complicated potion.
Harry Potter,How long will it take to make?
Hermione Granger,A month.
Harry Potter,A month?
Harry Potter,"But, Hermione Granger,"
Harry Potter,if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then.
Hermione Granger,I know.
Hermione Granger,But it's the only plan we've got.
LEE JORDAN,Another goal for Slytherin!
LEE JORDAN,They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30.
SLYTHERINS,Yeah! Yeah!
Draco Malfoy,"All right there, Scarhead?"
WOOD,"Watch yourself, Harry!"
Harry Potter,"Wood, look out!"
Rubeus Hagrid,Blimey! Harry's got himself a rogue Bludger.
Rubeus Hagrid,"That's been tampered with, that has."
Ron Weasley,I'll stop it.
Hermione Granger,"No! Even with a proper wand, it's too risky."
Hermione Granger,You could hit Harry.
Draco Malfoy,"Training for the ballet, Potter!!"
Draco Malfoy,"You'll never catch me, Potter."
Hermione Granger,Let's go.
LEE JORDAN,Harry Potter has caught the Snitch.
LEE JORDAN,Gryffindor wins!
Hermione Granger,Finite Incantatem!
Harry Potter,Thank you.
Hermione Granger,Are you okay?
Harry Potter,No. I think my arm is broken.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"Not to worry, Harry. "
GILDEROY LOCKHART,I will fix that arm of yours straight away.
Harry Potter,"No, Not you."
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Boy doesn't know what he's saying.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,This won't hurt a bit.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Brackium Emendo!
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"Yes, well, that can sometimes happen but the point is you can no longer feel any pain, and, very clearly, the bones are not broken."
Rubeus Hagrid,Broken? There's no bones left.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"Much more flexible, though."
MADAM POMFREY,"Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss."
MADAM POMFREY,You can go. Out of my way.
MADAM POMFREY,Should have been brought straight to me.
MADAM POMFREY,"I can mend bones in a heartbeat, but growing them back..."
Hermione Granger,"You will be able to, won't you?"
MADAM POMFREY,"I'll be able to, certainly."
MADAM POMFREY,But it'll be painful.
MADAM POMFREY,"You're in for a rough night, Potter."
MADAM POMFREY,Regrowing bones is a nasty business.
MADAM POMFREY,What do you expect?
MADAM POMFREY,Pumpkin juice?
VOICE,Kill. Kill.!!
VOICE,Time to kill..
DOBBY,Hello.
Harry Potter,Dobby?
DOBBY,Harry Potter should have listened to Dobby.
DOBBY,Harry Potter should have gone back home when he missed the train.
Harry Potter,It was you. 
Harry Potter,You stopped the barrier from letting Ron Weasley and me through.
DOBBY,"Indeed. Yes, sir."
Harry Potter,You nearly got Ron Weasley and me expelled.
DOBBY,At least you would be away from here.
DOBBY,Harry Potter must go home.
DOBBY,Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make Harry Potter see...
Harry Potter,Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?
DOBBY,"Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir."
DOBBY,Dobby had to iRon Weasley his hands.
Harry Potter,"You better clear off before my bones come back Dobby, or I might strangle you."
DOBBY,"Dobby is used to death threats, sir."
DOBBY,Dobby gets them five times a day at home.
Harry Potter,I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me?
DOBBY,"Not kill you, sir."
DOBBY,Never kill you.
DOBBY,Dobby remembers how it was before Harry Potter triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.
DOBBY,"We house-elves were treated like vermin, sir."
DOBBY,"Of course, Dobby is still treated like vermin."
Harry Potter,"Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?"
DOBBY,"This, sir? It is a mark of the house-elf's enslavement."
DOBBY,Dobby can only be freed if his master presents him with clothes.
DOBBY,Listen.
DOBBY,Listen!
DOBBY,Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts.
DOBBY,Harry Potter must not stay here...now that history is to repeat itself.
Harry Potter,Repeat itself? You mean this has happened before?
DOBBY,Oahh! I shouldn't have said that.
DOBBY,Bad Dobby! Bad!
Harry Potter,Stop it!
Harry Potter,"Stop it, Dobby!"
Harry Potter,Tell me Dobby when did this happen before?
Harry Potter,Who's doing it now?
DOBBY,"Dobby cannot say, sir. "
DOBBY,Dobby only wants Harry Potter to be safe.
Harry Potter,"No, Dobby. Tell me."
Harry Potter,Who is it?
MADAM POMFREY,Put him here.
MADAM POMFREY,What happened?
Albus Dumbledore,There's been another attack.
Minerva McGonagall,"I think he's been Petrified, Madam Pomfrey."
Minerva McGonagall,Look. Perhaps he managed to take a picture of his attacker.
Minerva McGonagall,"What can this mean, Albus?"
Albus Dumbledore,It means that our students are in great danger.
Minerva McGonagall,What should I tell the staff?
Albus Dumbledore,The truth.
Albus Dumbledore,Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe.
Albus Dumbledore,"It is as we feared, Minerva"
Albus Dumbledore,The Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again.
Hermione Granger,Again? You mean the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?
Ron Weasley,Of course.
Ron Weasley,Don't you see?
Ron Weasley,Lucius Malfoy must have opened it when he was at school here.
Ron Weasley,Now he's taught Draco how to do it.
Hermione Granger,Maybe.
Hermione Granger,We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.
Ron Weasley,Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight in the middle of the girls' lavatory?
Ron Weasley,Don't you think we'll get caught?
Hermione Granger,No. No one ever comes in here.
Ron Weasley,Why?
Hermione Granger,Moaning Myrtle.
Ron Weasley,Who?
Hermione Granger,Moaning Myrtle.
Ron Weasley,Who's Moaning Myrtle?
MOANING MYRTLE,I'm Moaning Myrtle.
MOANING MYRTLE,I wouldn't expect you to know me.
MOANING MYRTLE,"Who would ever talk about ugly, miserable moping Moaning Myrtle? Aaaaaa…"
Hermione Granger,She's a little sensitive.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Gather round!
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Gather round.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Can everybody see me?
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Can you all hear me?
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Excellent.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,In light of the dark events of recent weeks Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this Dueling Club to train you all up.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,In case you ever need to defend yourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"For full details, see my published works."
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Let me introduce my assistant Professor Snape.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,He has sportingly agreed to help with a short demonstration.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,I don't want any of you youngsters to worry.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,You'll still have your Potions master when I'm through with him. Never fear.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,One.Two. Three!
Severus Snape,Expelliarmus!
Hermione Granger,Do you think he's all right?
Ron Weasley,Who cares?
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"An excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape..."
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"but if you don't mind me saying, it was obvious what you were about to do."
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"If I had wanted to stop you, it would have been only too easy."
Severus Snape,"Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, professor."
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape.."
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Let's have a volunteer pair. 
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"Potter, Weasley, how about you?"
Severus Snape,Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells.
Severus Snape,We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox.
Severus Snape,Might I suggest someone from my own house?
Severus Snape,"Malfoy, perhaps?"
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"Good luck, Potter."
Harry Potter,"Thank you, sir."
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Wands at the ready.
Draco Malfoy,"Scared, Potter?"
Harry Potter,You wish.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,On the count of three cast your charms to disarm your opponent. Only to disarm.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,We don't want any accidents here.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,One. Two...
Draco Malfoy,Everte Statum!
Harry Potter,Rictusempra!
GILDEROY LOCKHART,I said disarm only.
Draco Malfoy,Serpensortia!
Severus Snape,"Don't move, Potter."
Severus Snape,I'll get rid of it for you.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"Allow me, Professor Snape."
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Alarte Ascendare!
Severus Snape,Vipera Evanesca.
JUSTIN FINCH-FLETCHLEY,What are you playing at?
Ron Weasley,You're a Parselmouth?
Ron Weasley,Why didn't you tell us?
Harry Potter,I'm a what?
Hermione Granger,You can talk to snakes.
Harry Potter,I know. I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.
Harry Potter,Once. But so what?
Harry Potter,I bet loads of people here can do it.
Hermione Granger,"No, they can't."
Hermione Granger,"It's not a very common gift, Harry."
Hermione Granger,This is bad.
Harry Potter,What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin...
Ron Weasley,That's what you said to it.
Harry Potter,You were there. You heard me.
Ron Weasley,I heard you speaking Parseltongue.
Ron Weasley,Snake language.
Harry Potter,I spoke a different language?
Harry Potter,But I didn't realize...
Harry Potter,How can I speak a language without knowing I can?
Hermione Granger,"I don't know, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on or something."
Hermione Granger,"Harry, listen to me."
Hermione Granger,There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin house is a serpent.
Hermione Granger,Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.
Hermione Granger,He could talk to snakes too.
Ron Weasley,Exactly.
Ron Weasley,Now the whole school's gonna think you're his great-great-great grandson.
Harry Potter,But I'm not.
Harry Potter,I can't be.
Hermione Granger,He lived a thousand years ago.
Hermione Granger,"For all we know, you could be."
Harry Potter,I'll see you back in the common room.
VOICE,I want blood.
VOICE,They all must die.
VOICE,Kill. Kill. Kill.
VOICE,Time to kill.
FILCH,Caught in the act.
FILCH,"I'll have you out this time, Potter."
FILCH,Mark my words.
Harry Potter,No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand...
Harry Potter,Professor I swear I didn't.
Minerva McGonagall,"This is out of my hands, Potter."
Minerva McGonagall,Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you.
Minerva McGonagall,Sherbet Lemon.
Harry Potter,Professor Dumbledore?
SORTING HAT,"Bee in your bonnet, Potter?"
Harry Potter,I...I..I was just wondering if you put me in the right house.
SORTING HAT,Yes. You were particularly difficult to place.
SORTING HAT,But I stand by what I said last year.
SORTING HAT,You would have done well in Slytherin.
Harry Potter,You're wRon Weasleyg.
Albus Dumbledore,Harry?
Harry Potter,Professor.
Harry Potter,Your bird...There was nothing I could do.
Harry Potter,He just caught fire.
Albus Dumbledore,And about time too.
Albus Dumbledore,He's been looking dreadful for days.
Albus Dumbledore,Pity you had to see him on a burning day.
Albus Dumbledore,"Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry."
Albus Dumbledore,They burst into flame when it is time for them to die...
Albus Dumbledore,and then they are reborn from the ashes.
Albus Dumbledore,"Fascinating creatures, phoenixes."
Albus Dumbledore,They can carry immensely heavy loads.
Albus Dumbledore,Their tears have healing powers.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Professor Dumbledore, sir!"
Rubeus Hagrid,Wait! Listen!
Rubeus Hagrid,"Professor Dumbledore, sir, it wasn't Harry."
Rubeus Hagrid,I'd be prepared to swear it in fRon Weasleyt of the Ministry of Magic.
Albus Dumbledore,Hagriiid!! Relax.
Albus Dumbledore,I do not believe that Harry attacked anyone.
Rubeus Hagrid,Of course you don't.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Ohh! Oww! Right. Well, I'll..."
Rubeus Hagrid,"I'll just wait outside, then."
Albus Dumbledore,Yes.
Harry Potter,"You don't think it was me, professor?"
Albus Dumbledore,"No, Harry. I do not think it was you."
Albus Dumbledore,But I must ask you is there something you wish to tell me?
Harry Potter,"No, sir. Nothing"
Albus Dumbledore,"Very well, then."
Albus Dumbledore,Off you go.
Hermione Granger,Everything's set. 
Hermione Granger,We just need a bit of who you're changing into.
Harry Potter,Crabbe and Goyle.
Hermione Granger,We also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy.
Ron Weasley,How?
Hermione Granger,I've got it all worked out.
Hermione Granger,I filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught.
Hermione Granger,"Simple, but powerful."
Hermione Granger,"Now, once they're asleep hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs and put on their uniforms."
Ron Weasley,"Whose hair are you ripping out, then?"
Hermione Granger,I've already got mine.
Hermione Granger,Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.
Hermione Granger,I got this off her robes.
Hermione Granger,I'm going to go check on the Polyjuice Potion.
Hermione Granger,Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle find these.
Harry Potter,"Ron Weasley, maybe I should do it."
Ron Weasley,Yeah. Right.
Harry Potter,Wingardium Leviosa.
CRABBE,Cool. Umm..um.
Ron Weasley,How thick could you get?
Harry Potter,"Come on, let's get them."
Hermione Granger,We'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves.
Hermione Granger,Add the hairs.
Ron Weasley,Essence of Crabbe.
Hermione Granger,Cheers.
Ron Weasley,I think I'm gonna be sick.
Hermione Granger,Me too.
Ron Weasley,Harry?
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley.
Ron Weasley,Bloody hell!
Harry Potter,We still sound like ourselves.
Harry Potter,You need to sound more like Crabbe.
Ron Weasley,Bloody hell.
Harry Potter,Excellent.
Ron Weasley,But where's Hermione Granger?
Hermione Granger,I...I don't think I'm going.
Hermione Granger,You go on without me.
Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, are you okay?"
Hermione Granger,Just go. You're wasting time.
Harry Potter,Come on.
Harry Potter,I think the Slytherin common room's this way.
PERCY,Excuse me.
Ron Weasley,What are you doing d...?
Ron Weasley,"I mean, what are you doing down here?"
PERCY,I happen to be a school prefect.
PERCY,"You, on the other hand, have no business wandering the corridors at night."
PERCY,What are your names again?
Harry Potter,I'm...
Draco Malfoy,"Crabbe, Goyle, where have you been?"
Draco Malfoy,Pigging out in the Great Hall all this time?
Draco Malfoy,Why are you wearing glasses?
Harry Potter,Ah- um.. Reading.
Draco Malfoy,Reading?
Draco Malfoy,I didn't know you could read.
Draco Malfoy,"And what are you doing down here, Weasley?"
PERCY,"Mind your attitude, Malfoy."
Draco Malfoy,"Well, sit down."
Draco Malfoy,"You'd never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave."
Draco Malfoy,They're an embarrassment to the wizarding world. All of them.
Draco Malfoy,"What's wRon Weasleyg with you, Crabbe?"
Ron Weasley,Stomachache.
Draco Malfoy,I'm surprised the Daily Prophet hasn't done a report on all these attacks.
Draco Malfoy,I suppose Dumbledore is trying to hush it all up.
Draco Malfoy,Father always said Dumbledore was the worst thing that ever happened to this place.
Harry Potter,You're wRon Weasleyg!
Draco Malfoy,What?
Draco Malfoy,You think there's someone here who's worse than Dumbledore?
Draco Malfoy,Well? Do you?
Harry Potter,Harry Potter?
Draco Malfoy,"Good one, Goyle."
Draco Malfoy,You're absolutely right.
Draco Malfoy,Saint Potter.
Draco Malfoy,And people actually think that he's the Heir of Slytherin?
Harry Potter,But then you must have some idea who's behind it all.
Draco Malfoy,"You know I don't, Goyle."
Draco Malfoy,I told you yesterday.
Draco Malfoy,How many times do I have to tell you?
Draco Malfoy,Is this yours?
Draco Malfoy,But my father did say this:
Draco Malfoy,It's been 50 years since the Chamber was opened.
Draco Malfoy,He wouldn't tell me who opened it.
Draco Malfoy,Only that they were expelled.
Draco Malfoy,"The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died."
Draco Malfoy,So it's only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time.
Draco Malfoy,As for me I hope it's Granger.
Draco Malfoy,What's the matter with you two?
Draco Malfoy,You're acting very odd.
Harry Potter,It's his stomachache.
Harry Potter,Calm down.
Ron Weasley,Scar!
Harry Potter,Hair!
Draco Malfoy,Hey! Where are you going?
Ron Weasley,That was close.
Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger, come out."
Harry Potter,We've got loads to tell you.
Hermione Granger,Go away.
MOANING MYRTLE,Wait till you see. It's awful.
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger?
Harry Potter,Are you okay?
Hermione Granger,Do you remember me telling you that the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations?
Hermione Granger,It was cat hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode's robes.
Hermione Granger,Look at my face.
Ron Weasley,Look at your tail.
Ron Weasley,Have you spoken to Hermione Granger?
Harry Potter,She should be out of hospital in a few days when she stops coughing up fur balls.
Harry Potter,What's this?
Ron Weasley,Yuck!
Harry Potter,Looks like Moaning Myrtle's flooded the bathroom.
MOANING MYRTLE,Ohh-Uhh..Come to throw something else at me?
Harry Potter,Why would I throw something at you?
MOANING MYRTLE,"Don't ask me. Here I am, minding my own business and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me."
Ron Weasley,But it can't hurt if someone throws something at you.
Ron Weasley,"I mean, it'll just go right through you."
MOANING MYRTLE,SURE! Let's all throw books at Myrtle because she can't feel it.
MOANING MYRTLE,Ten points if you get it through her stomach!
MOANING MYRTLE,Fifty points if it goes through her head!
Harry Potter,"But who threw it at you, anyway?"
MOANING MYRTLE,I don't know. I didn't see them.
MOANING MYRTLE,"I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death and it fell through the top of my head."
MOANING MYRTLE,Whoo-oooh-whoooo...
Harry Potter,"""Tom Marvolo Riddle."""
Harry Potter,My name is Harry Potter.
DIARY,"Hello Harry Potter, my name is Tom Riddle."
Harry Potter,Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?
DIARY,Yes.
Harry Potter,Can you tell me?
DIARY,No. But I can show you.
DIARY,Let me take you back fifty years ago.
DIARY,13th June..
Harry Potter,Excuse me. 
Harry Potter,Could you tell me what's going on here?
Harry Potter,Are you Tom Riddle?
Harry Potter,"Hello, can you hear me?"
Albus Dumbledore,Riddle! Come.
Voldemort,Professor Dumbledore.
Harry Potter,Dumbledore?
Albus Dumbledore,"It is not wise to be wandering around this late hour, Tom."
Voldemort,"Yes, professor. I suppose I..."
Voldemort,I had to see for myself if the rumors were true.
Albus Dumbledore,"I'm afraid they are, Tom."
Albus Dumbledore,They are true.
Voldemort,About the school as well?
Voldemort,I don't have a home to go to.
Voldemort,"They wouldn't really close Hogwarts, would they, professor?"
Albus Dumbledore,"I understand, Tom, but I'm afraid Headmaster Dippet may have no choice."
Voldemort,"Sir, if it all stopped, if the person responsible was caught..."
Albus Dumbledore,Is there something you wish to tell me?
Voldemort,"No, sir. Nothing."
Albus Dumbledore,"Very well, then. Off you go."
Voldemort,"Good night, sir."
Rubeus Hagrid,Let's get you out of there.
Voldemort,"Evening, Hagrid."
Voldemort,I'm going to have to turn you in Hagrid
Voldemort,I don't think you meant it to kill anyone...
Rubeus Hagrid,You can't. You don't understand.
Voldemort,The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. 
Voldemort,The least Hogwarts can do is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered.
Rubeus Hagrid,It wasn't him.
Rubeus Hagrid,Aragog never killed no one. Never.
Voldemort,"Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid."
Voldemort,"Now, stand aside."
Rubeus Hagrid,No!
Voldemort,"Stand aside, Hagrid."
Rubeus Hagrid,No!
Voldemort,Cistem Aperio!
Voldemort,Arania Exumai!
Rubeus Hagrid,Aragog! Aragog!
Voldemort,I can't let you go.
Voldemort,"They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid."
Voldemort,You'll be expelled.
Harry Potter,Hagrid!
Harry Potter,HAAGRIIID!
Harry Potter,Wow!
Harry Potter,It was Hagrid. 
Harry Potter,Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.
Hermione Granger,It can't be Hagrid.
Hermione Granger,It just can't be.
Ron Weasley,We don't even know this Tom Riddle.
Ron Weasley,"He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch."
Harry Potter,"The monster had killed somebody, Ron Weasley."
Harry Potter,What would any of us have done?
Hermione Granger,"Look, Hagrid's our friend. "
Hermione Granger,Why don't we just go and ask him about it?
Ron Weasley,That would be a cheerful visit.
Ron Weasley,"Hello, Hagrid. Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"
Rubeus Hagrid,"Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking about me, now, would you?"
Harry Potter-Ron Weasley-Hermione Granger,No.
Harry Potter,"What's that you've got, Hagrid?"
Rubeus Hagrid,It's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.
Rubeus Hagrid,"For the Mandrakes, you know."
Rubeus Hagrid,"Now, according to Professor Sprout, they've still got a bit of growing to do."
Rubeus Hagrid,"But once their acne's cleared up, we'll chop them up and stew them. and then we'll get those people down at the hospital un-Petrified."
Rubeus Hagrid,"In the meantime, though, you three had best be looking after yourselves."
Rubeus Hagrid,All right?
Rubeus Hagrid,"Hello, Neville."
NEVILLE,"Harry, I don't know who did it, but you'd better come."
NEVILLE,Come on!
Hermione Granger,It had to be a Gryffindor.
Hermione Granger,Nobody else knows our password.
Hermione Granger,Unless it wasn't a student.
Ron Weasley,"Whoever it was, they must have been looking for something."
Harry Potter,And they found it.
Harry Potter,Tom Riddle's diary is gone.
WOOD,"All right, listen up."
WOOD,"We play our game, Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance."
WOOD,"We're stRon Weasleyger, quicker and smarter."
FRED,Not to mention they're dead scared that Harry will Petrify them if they fly anywhere near him.
WOOD,"Well, that too."
WOOD,Professor McGonagall.
Minerva McGonagall,This match has been canceled.
WOOD,We can't cancel Quidditch.
Minerva McGonagall,"Silence, Wood. You and your teammates will go to Gryffindor Tower. Now."
Minerva McGonagall,"Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley."
Minerva McGonagall,There's something the both of you have to see.
Minerva McGonagall,I warn you.
Minerva McGonagall,This could be a wee bit of a shock.
Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger!
Minerva McGonagall,She was found near the library along with this.
Minerva McGonagall,Does it mean anything to either of you?
Harry Potter,No.
Minerva McGonagall,"Could I have your attention, please?"
Minerva McGonagall,"Because of recent events, these new rules will be put into effect immediately:"
Minerva McGonagall,All students will return to their house common rooms by 6:00 every evening.
Minerva McGonagall,All students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher.
Minerva McGonagall,No exceptions.
Minerva McGonagall,I should tell you this:
Minerva McGonagall,Unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught it is likely the school will be closed.
Harry Potter,"We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron Weasley."
Harry Potter,I can't believe it's him but if he did set the monster loose last time he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets. That's a start.
Ron Weasley,But you heard McGonagall.
Ron Weasley,We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class.
Harry Potter,I think it's time to get my dad's old cloak out again.
Rubeus Hagrid,Who's there?
Rubeus Hagrid,Hello? Hello?
Harry Potter,What's that for?
Rubeus Hagrid,Nothing. I was expecting... It doesn't matter. Come on in.
Rubeus Hagrid,I just made a pot of tea.
Harry Potter,"Hagrid, are you okay?"
Rubeus Hagrid,I'm fine. I'm all right.
Harry Potter,Did you hear about Hermione Granger?
Rubeus Hagrid,"Oh yeah. I heard about that, all right."
Harry Potter,"Look, we have to ask you something."
Harry Potter,Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets?
Rubeus Hagrid,What you had to understand about that is...
Rubeus Hagrid,"Quick, under the cloak."
Rubeus Hagrid,Don't say a word.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Be quiet, both of you."
Rubeus Hagrid,"Professor Dumbledore, sir."
Albus Dumbledore,"Good evening, Hagrid."
Albus Dumbledore,"I wonder, could we...?"
Rubeus Hagrid,Of course. Come in. Come in.
Ron Weasley,That's Dad's boss.
Ron Weasley,"Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic."
FUDGE,"Bad business, Hagrid, very bad business."
FUDGE,Had to come.
FUDGE,Three attacks on Muggle-borns.
FUDGE,Things have gone far enough.
FUDGE,The Ministry's got to act.
Rubeus Hagrid,But I never...
Rubeus Hagrid,"You know I never, professor."
Albus Dumbledore,"I want it understood, Cornelius that Hagrid has my full confidence."
FUDGE,"Albus, look, Hagrid's record is against him."
FUDGE,I've got to take him.
Rubeus Hagrid,Take me? Take me where?
Rubeus Hagrid,Not Azkaban prison.
FUDGE,"I'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid."
LUCIUS MALFOY,"Already here, Fudge?"
LUCIUS MALFOY,Good.
Rubeus Hagrid,What are you doing here?
Rubeus Hagrid,Get out of my house!
LUCIUS MALFOY,Believe me I take absolutely no pleasure being inside your...
LUCIUS MALFOY,You call this a house?
LUCIUS MALFOY,No.
LUCIUS MALFOY,I simply called up the school and was told the headmaster was here.
Albus Dumbledore,"Well, what exactly is it that you want with me?"
LUCIUS MALFOY,The other governors and I have decided it's time for you to step aside.
LUCIUS MALFOY,This is an order of suspension.
LUCIUS MALFOY,You'll find all 12 signatures on it.
LUCIUS MALFOY,I'm afraid we feel you've rather lost your touch.
LUCIUS MALFOY,"Well, what, with all these attacks there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts."
LUCIUS MALFOY,I can only imagine what an awful loss that would be to the school.
Rubeus Hagrid,You can't take Professor Dumbledore away.
Rubeus Hagrid,Take him away and the Muggle-borns won't stand a chance.
Rubeus Hagrid,"You mark my words, there'll be killings next!"
LUCIUS MALFOY,You think so?
Albus Dumbledore,"Calm yourself, Hagrid."
Albus Dumbledore,"If the governors desire my removal I will, of course, step aside."
Albus Dumbledore,However you will find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.
LUCIUS MALFOY,Admirable sentiments.
LUCIUS MALFOY,Shall we?
LUCIUS MALFOY,Fudge.
FUDGE,"Come, Hagrid."
Rubeus Hagrid,Well? If...
Rubeus Hagrid,If anybody was looking for some stuff then all they'd have to do would be to follow the spiders.
Rubeus Hagrid,Yep. That would lead them right.
Rubeus Hagrid,That's all I have to say.
Rubeus Hagrid,And someone will need to feed Fang while I'm away.
FUDGE,Good boy.
Ron Weasley,Hagrid's right.
Ron Weasley,"With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day."
Harry Potter,Look.
Harry Potter,Come on.
Harry Potter,"Come on, Fang."
Harry Potter,Come on.
Ron Weasley,What?
Harry Potter,You heard what Hagrid said.
Harry Potter,Follow the spiders.
Ron Weasley,They're heading to the Dark Forest.
Ron Weasley,"Why spiders? Why couldn't it be ""follow the butterflies""?"
Ron Weasley,"Harry, I don't like this."
Ron Weasley,"Harry, I don't like this at all."
Harry Potter,Shush!
Ron Weasley,Can we go back now?
Harry Potter,Come on.
ARAGOG,Who is it?
Harry Potter,Don't panic.
ARAGOG,Hagrid?
ARAGOG,Is that you?
Harry Potter,We're friends of Hagrid's.
Harry Potter,And you?
Harry Potter,"You're Aragog, aren't you?"
ARAGOG,Yes.
ARAGOG,Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before.
Harry Potter,"He's in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks."
Harry Potter,They think it's Hagrid.
Harry Potter,They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.
ARAGOG,That's a lie.
ARAGOG,Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.
Harry Potter,Then you're not the monster?
ARAGOG,No.
ARAGOG,The monster was born in the castle.
ARAGOG,I came to Hagrid from a distant land in the pocket of a traveler.
Ron Weasley,Harry.
Harry Potter,"But if you're not the monster, then what did kill that girl 50 years ago?"
ARAGOG,We do not speak of it.
ARAGOG,It is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others.
Harry Potter,But have you seen it?
ARAGOG,I never saw any part of the castle but the box in which Hagrid kept me.
ARAGOG,The girl was discovered in a bathroom.
ARAGOG,"When I was accused, Hagrid brought me here."
Ron Weasley,Harry!
Harry Potter,What?
Harry Potter,"Well, thank you."
Harry Potter,We'll just go.
ARAGOG,Go?
ARAGOG,I think not.
ARAGOG,My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid on my command.
ARAGOG,But I cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst.
ARAGOG,"Goodbye, friend of Hagrid."
Ron Weasley,Can we panic now?
Ron Weasley,Know any spells?
Harry Potter,"One, but it's not powerful enough for all of them."
Ron Weasley,Where's Hermione Granger when you need her?
Harry Potter,Let's go!
Harry Potter,Arania Exumai!
Harry Potter,Go!
Ron Weasley,Glad we're out of there.
Harry Potter,Arania Exumai!
Ron Weasley,Thanks for that.
Harry Potter,Don't mention it.
Harry Potter,Get us out of here.
Harry Potter,Now!
Harry Potter,Come on!
Harry Potter,"Come on, move faster!"
Harry Potter,Come on! Go!
Harry Potter,Get us in the air.
Ron Weasley,The flying gear's jammed!
Harry Potter,Come on! Pull!
Ron Weasley,I'm trying!
Ron Weasley,Follow the spiders!
Ron Weasley,Follow the spiders.
Ron Weasley,"If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill him."
Ron Weasley,"I mean, what was the point of sending us in there?"
Ron Weasley,What have we found out?
Harry Potter,We know one thing.
Harry Potter,Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.
Harry Potter,He was innocent.
Harry Potter,"Wish you were here, Hermione Granger."
Harry Potter,We need you.
Harry Potter,Now more than ever.
Ron Weasley,What's that?
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley...
Harry Potter,This is why Hermione Granger was in the library the day she was attacked.
Harry Potter,Come on.
Harry Potter,"Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land none is more deadly than the basilisk."
Harry Potter,Capable of living for hundreds of years instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye.
Harry Potter,Spiders flee before it.
Harry Potter,"Ron Weasley, this is it."
Harry Potter,The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk.
Harry Potter,That's why I can hear it speak.
Harry Potter,It's a snake.
Ron Weasley,"But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one's dead?"
Harry Potter,Because no one did look it in the eye.
Harry Potter,"Not directly, at least."
Harry Potter,Colin saw it through his camera.
Harry Potter,Justin... Justin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick.
Harry Potter,Nick got the full blast of it.
Harry Potter,"But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again."
Harry Potter,And Hermione Granger had the mirror.
Harry Potter,I bet you she was using it to look around corners in case it came along.
Ron Weasley,And Mrs. Norris?
Ron Weasley,"I'm pretty sure she didn't havea camera or a mirror, Harry."
Harry Potter,The water.
Harry Potter,There was water on the floor that night.
Harry Potter,She only saw the basilisk's reflection.
Harry Potter,Spiders flee before it.
Harry Potter,It all fits.
Ron Weasley,How's a basilisk been getting around?
Ron Weasley,"A dirty, great snake."
Ron Weasley,Someone would have seen it.
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger's answered that too.
Ron Weasley,Pipes? It's using the plumbing.
Harry Potter,Remember what Aragog said about that girl 50 years ago?
Harry Potter,She died in a bathroom?
Harry Potter,What if she never left?
Ron Weasley,Moaning Myrtle.
Minerva McGonagall,All students are to return to their house dormitories at once.
Minerva McGonagall,All teachers to the second-floor corridor immediately.
Minerva McGonagall,"As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message."
Minerva McGonagall,Our worst fear has been realized.
Minerva McGonagall,A student has been taken by the monster into the Chamber itself.
Minerva McGonagall,The students must be sent home.
Minerva McGonagall,I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,So sorry. Dozed off.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,What have I missed?
Severus Snape,"A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. "
Severus Snape,Your moment has come at last.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,My moment?
Severus Snape,Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?
Minerva McGonagall,That's settled. 
Minerva McGonagall,"We'll leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy."
Minerva McGonagall,"Your skills, after all, are legend."
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Very well.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,I'll just be in my office getting...
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Getting ready.
MADAM POMFREY,"Who is it that the monster's taken, Minerva?"
Minerva McGonagall,Ginny Weasley.
Ron Weasley,Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever.
Ron Weasley,Ginny.
Harry Potter,"Lockhart may be useless, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber."
Harry Potter,At least we can tell him what we know.
Harry Potter,"Professor, we have some information for you."
Harry Potter,Are you going somewhere?
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"Well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable."
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Got to go.
Ron Weasley,What about my sister?
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Well… Aemm…
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"As to that, most unfortunate."
GILDEROY LOCKHART,No one regrets more than I.
Ron Weasley,You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. 
Ron Weasley,You can't go now.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"I must say, when I took the job, there was nothing in the description..."
Harry Potter,You're running away?
Harry Potter,After all you did in your books?
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Books can be misleading.
Harry Potter,You wrote them.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"My dear boy, use your common sense."
GILDEROY LOCKHART,My books wouldn't have sold as well if people didn't think I'd done those things.
Harry Potter,You're a fraud.
Harry Potter,You've been taking credit for what other wizards have done.
Ron Weasley,Is there anything you can do?
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"Yes, now you mention it."
GILDEROY LOCKHART,I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"Otherwise, all those wizards would have gone blabbing."
GILDEROY LOCKHART,I'd never have sold another book.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"In fact, I'm going to have to do the same to you."
Harry Potter,Don't even think about it.
MOANING MYRTLE,Who's there?
MOANING MYRTLE,"Hello, Harry."
MOANING MYRTLE,What do you want?
Harry Potter,To ask you how you died.
MOANING MYRTLE,It was dreadful.
MOANING MYRTLE,It happened right here in this very cubicle.
MOANING MYRTLE,I'd hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses.
MOANING MYRTLE,"I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in."
Harry Potter,"Who was it, Myrtle?"
MOANING MYRTLE,I don't know. I was distraught!
MOANING MYRTLE,"But they said something funny, a kind of made-up language."
MOANING MYRTLE,"And I realized it was a boy, so I unlocked the door to tell him to go away and I died."
Harry Potter,Just like that? How?
MOANING MYRTLE,"I just remember seeing a pair of great, big, yellow eyes over there by that sink."
Harry Potter,This is it.
Harry Potter,"This is it, Ron Weasley. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets."
Ron Weasley,Say something. 
Ron Weasley,Harry say something in Parseltongue!
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"Excellent, Harry. Good work."
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"Well, then, I'll just be..."
GILDEROY LOCKHART,There's no need for me to stay.
Harry Potter,"Yes, there is."
Harry Potter,You first.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"Now, boys, what good will it do?"
Ron Weasley,Better you than us.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"But... Obviously, yes."
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Sure you don't want to test it first?
GILDEROY LOCKHART,It's really quite filthy down here.
Harry Potter,All right. Let's go.
MOANING MYRTLE,"Oh, Harry?"
MOANING MYRTLE,"If you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet."
Harry Potter,"Thanks, Myrtle."
Harry Potter,"Now, remember: Any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway."
Ron Weasley,Go on.
Harry Potter,This way.
Ron Weasley,What's this?
GILDEROY LOCKHART,It looks like a snake.
Harry Potter,It's a snake skin.
Ron Weasley,Bloody hell.
Ron Weasley,Whatever shed this must be 60 feet long. Or more.
Ron Weasley,"Heart of a lion, this one."
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"The adventure ends here, boys."
GILDEROY LOCKHART,But don't fret.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,The world will know our story.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,How I was too late to save the girl.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,How you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"So...You first, Mr. Potter."
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Say goodbye to your memories.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Obliviate!
Ron Weasley,Harry! Harry
Harry Potter,"Ron Weasley! Ron Weasley, are you okay?"
Ron Weasley,I'm fine.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Hello. Who are you?
Ron Weasley,Ron Weasley Weasley.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Really?
GILDEROY LOCKHART,And who am I?
Ron Weasley,Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired.
Ron Weasley,He hasn't got a clue who he is.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"It's an odd sort of place, isn't it?"
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Do you live here?
Ron Weasley,No.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Really?
Ron Weasley,What do I do now?
Harry Potter,You wait here and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through.
Harry Potter,I'll go on and find Ginny.
Ron Weasley,Okay.
Harry Potter,"Ginny! Ginny, please don't be dead."
Harry Potter,"Wake up, wake up."
Harry Potter,Please wake up.
Voldemort,She won't wake.
Harry Potter,Tom. Tom Riddle.
Harry Potter,"What do you mean, she won't wake?"
Harry Potter,She's not...?
Voldemort,"She's still alive, but only just."
Harry Potter,Are you a ghost?
Voldemort,A memory preserved in a diary for 50 years.
Harry Potter,She's cold as ice.
Harry Potter,"Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up."
Harry Potter,"You've got to help me, Tom."
Harry Potter,There's a basilisk.
Voldemort,It won't come until it's called.
Harry Potter,"Give me my wand, Tom."
Voldemort,You won't be needing it.
Harry Potter,We've got to go. We've got to save her.
Voldemort,I'm afraid I can't do that.
Voldemort,"You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker, I grow stRon Weasleyger."
Voldemort,"Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets."
Harry Potter,No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.
Voldemort,It was Ginny who set the basilisk on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat Ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls.
Harry Potter,But why?
Voldemort,Because I told her to.
Voldemort,You'll find I can be very persuasive.
Voldemort,Not that she knew what she was doing.
Voldemort,"She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance."
Voldemort,"Still, the power of the diary began to scare her."
Voldemort,She tried to dispose of it in the girls' bathroom.
Voldemort,And then who should find it but you?
Voldemort,The very person I was most anxious to meet.
Harry Potter,And why did you want to meet me?
Voldemort,"I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could."
Voldemort,So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf Hagrid to gain your trust.
Harry Potter,Hagrid's my friend.
Harry Potter,"And you framed him, didn't you?"
Voldemort,It was my word against Hagrid's.
Voldemort,Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent.
Harry Potter,I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
Voldemort,He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that.
Voldemort,I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was at school so I decided to leave behind a diary preserving my 16-year-old self in its pages so that one day
Voldemort,I would be able to lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work.
Harry Potter,"Well, you haven't finished it this time."
Harry Potter,"In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught will be ready."
Harry Potter,And everyone who was Petrified will be all right again.
Voldemort,Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore.
Voldemort,"For many months now, my new target has been you."
Voldemort,How is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time?
Voldemort,How did you escape with nothing but a scar while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?
Harry Potter,Why do you care how I escaped?
Harry Potter,Voldemort was after your time.
Voldemort,"Voldemort is my past, present and future."
Harry Potter,You. You're the Heir of Slytherin.
Harry Potter,You're Voldemort.
Voldemort,Surely you didn't think .I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father's name?
Voldemort,"No. I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would fear to speak when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world."
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world.
Voldemort,Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me.
Harry Potter,He'll never be gone. 
Harry Potter,Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him.
Harry Potter,Fawkes?
Voldemort,So this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender.
Voldemort,A songbird and an old hat.
Voldemort,"Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin against the famous Harry Potter."
Voldemort,"Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter. "
Voldemort,It only obeys me.
Voldemort,"No! Your bird may have blinded the basilisk, but it can still hear you."
Voldemort,"Yes, Potter."
Voldemort,The process is nearly complete.
Voldemort,"In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be dead, and I will cease to be a memory."
Voldemort,Lord Voldemort will return .very much alive.
Harry Potter,Ginny?
Voldemort,"Remarkable, isn't it? how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body?"
Voldemort,I'd guess you have little more than a minute to live.
Voldemort,"You'll be with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry."
Voldemort,"Funny, the damage a silly little book can do especially in the hands of a silly little girl."
Voldemort,What are you doing?
Voldemort,Stop. No!
Harry Potter,Ginny?
GINNY,"Harry, It was me."
GINNY,"But I swear, I didn't mean to."
GINNY,"Riddle made me, and..."
GINNY,"Harry, you're hurt."
Harry Potter,Don't worry.
Harry Potter,"Ginny, you need to get yourself out."
Harry Potter,Follow the Chamber and you'll find Ron Weasley.
Harry Potter,"You were brilliant, Fawkes."
Harry Potter,I just wasn't quick enough.
Harry Potter,Of course.
Harry Potter,Phoenix tears have healing powers.
Harry Potter,Thanks.
Harry Potter,"It's all right, Ginny."
Harry Potter,It's over.
Harry Potter,It's just a memory.
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Amazing!
GILDEROY LOCKHART,This is just like magic!
Albus Dumbledore,"You both realize, of course that in the past few hours, you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules."
Harry Potter AND Ron Weasley,"Yes, sir."
Albus Dumbledore,There is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.
Harry Potter AND Ron Weasley,"Yes, sir."
Albus Dumbledore,"Therefore, it is only fitting that you both receive Special Awards for Services to the School."
Ron Weasley,"Thanks, sir."
Albus Dumbledore,"Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban."
Albus Dumbledore,I believe we want our gamekeeper back.
Albus Dumbledore,"Harry, First, I want to thank you, Harry."
Albus Dumbledore,You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber.
Albus Dumbledore,Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you.
Albus Dumbledore,And second I sense that something is troubling you.
Albus Dumbledore,"Am I right, Harry?"
Harry Potter,It's just...
Harry Potter,"You see, sir, I couldn't help but notice certain things, certain..."
Harry Potter,Certain similarities between Tom Riddle and me.
Albus Dumbledore,I see.
Albus Dumbledore,"Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why?"
Albus Dumbledore,Because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue.
Albus Dumbledore,"If I'm not mistaken, Harry he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar."
Harry Potter,Voldemort transferred some of his powers to me?
Albus Dumbledore,Not intentionally but yes.
Harry Potter,So the Sorting Hat was right.
Harry Potter,I should be in Slytherin.
Albus Dumbledore,It's true. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes.
Albus Dumbledore,"Determination, resourcefulness and if I may say so, a certain disregard for the rules."
Albus Dumbledore,"Why, then, did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor?"
Harry Potter,Because I asked it to.
Albus Dumbledore,"Exactly, Harry. Exactly."
Albus Dumbledore,Which makes you different from Voldemort.
Albus Dumbledore,It is not our abilities that show what we truly are.
Albus Dumbledore,It is our choices.
Albus Dumbledore,If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor then I suggest you look more closely at this.
Albus Dumbledore,Be careful.
Harry Potter,Godric Gryffindor.
Albus Dumbledore,It would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat.
Harry Potter,Dobby.
Harry Potter,So this is your master.
Harry Potter,The family you serve is the Malfoys.
LUCIUS MALFOY,I'll deal with you later.
LUCIUS MALFOY,"Out of my way, Potter."
LUCIUS MALFOY,So it's true. You have returned.
Albus Dumbledore,"When the governors learned that Arthur Weasley's daughter was taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back."
LUCIUS MALFOY,Ridiculous.
Albus Dumbledore,"Curiously, Lucius, several of them were under the impression that you would curse their family if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place."
LUCIUS MALFOY,How dare you!
Albus Dumbledore,Beg your pardon?
LUCIUS MALFOY,"My sole concern has always been and will always be the welfare of this school and, of course, its students."
LUCIUS MALFOY,"The culprit has been identified, I presume?"
Albus Dumbledore,Yes.
LUCIUS MALFOY,And?
LUCIUS MALFOY,Who was it?
Albus Dumbledore,Voldemort.
Albus Dumbledore,Only this time he chose to act through somebody else by means of this.
LUCIUS MALFOY,I see.
Albus Dumbledore,"Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it."
Albus Dumbledore,One hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old school-things should find their way into innocent hands.
Albus Dumbledore,The consequences for the one responsible would be severe.
LUCIUS MALFOY,"Well, let us hope that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day."
Harry Potter,Don't worry. I will be.
LUCIUS MALFOY,Dumbledore.
LUCIUS MALFOY,"Come, Dobby. We're leaving."
Harry Potter,Sir? I wonder if I could have that?
Harry Potter,Mr. Malfoy.
Harry Potter,Mr. Malfoy!
Harry Potter,I have something of yours.
LUCIUS MALFOY,Mine? I don't know what you're talking about.
Harry Potter,"I think you do, sir."
Harry Potter,I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldRon Weasley that day at Diagon Alley.
LUCIUS MALFOY,"You do, do you?"
LUCIUS MALFOY,Why don't you prove it?
LUCIUS MALFOY,"Come, Dobby."
Harry Potter,Open it.
LUCIUS MALFOY,Dobby.
DOBBY,Master has given Dobby a sock.
LUCIUS MALFOY,What? I didn't give...
DOBBY,Master has presented Dobby with clothes.
DOBBY,Dobby is free.
LUCIUS MALFOY,You lost me my servant!
DOBBY,You shall not harm Harry Potter.
LUCIUS MALFOY,Your parents were meddlesome fools too.
LUCIUS MALFOY,"Mark my words, Potter."
LUCIUS MALFOY,One day soon you are going to meet the same sticky end.
DOBBY,Harry Potter freed Dobby.
DOBBY,How can Dobby ever repay him?
Harry Potter,Just promise me something.
DOBBY,"Anything, sir."
Harry Potter,Never try to save my life again.
STUDENT,"Welcome back, Sir Nicholas."
SIR NICHOLAS,Thank you.
STUDENT,"Good evening, Sir Nicholas."
SIR NICHOLAS,Good evening.
STUDENT,"Good to see you, Sir Nicholas."
SIR NICHOLAS,Thank you.
SIR NICHOLAS,Hello.
SIR NICHOLAS,Hermione Granger! Welcome back.
Hermione Granger,"Thanks, Sir Nicholas."
NEVILLE,Harry. It's Hermione Granger.
Ron Weasley,"Welcome back, Hermione Granger."
Hermione Granger,It's good to be back.
Hermione Granger,Congratulations.
Hermione Granger,I can't believe you solved it.
Harry Potter,We had loads of help from you.
Harry Potter,We couldn't have done it without you.
Hermione Granger,Thanks.
Minerva McGonagall,"Could I have your attention, please?"
Albus Dumbledore,"Before we begin the feast let us have a round of applause for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey whose Mandrake juice has been so successfully administered to all who had been Petrified."
Albus Dumbledore,"Also, in light of the recent events as a school treat all exams have been canceled."
Hermione Granger,"Oh, no."
Rubeus Hagrid,Sorry I'm late.
Rubeus Hagrid,The owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused.
Rubeus Hagrid,Some ruddy bird called Errol.
Rubeus Hagrid,"And I'd just like to say that if it hadn't been for you, Harry and Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, of course I would still be you-know-where so I'd just like to say thanks."
Harry Potter,"There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid."
