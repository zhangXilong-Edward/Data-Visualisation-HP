Harry Potter,Lumos Maxima...
Harry Potter,Lumos... MAXIMA!
AUNT PETUNIA,Harry! Harry!
AUNT PETUNIA,Harry!! Open the door.
AUNT PETUNIA,Marge! How lovely to seeâ€¦
Harry Potter,Uncle Vernon. I need you to sign this form.
UNCLE VERNON,What is it?
Harry Potter,Nothing. School stuff
UNCLE VERNON,Later perhaps. If you behave.
Harry Potter,I will if she does.
AUNT MARGE,"You still here, are you?"
Harry Potter,Yes.
AUNT MARGE,Don't say 'yes' in that ungrateful way.
AUNT MARGE,Damn good of my brother to keep you.
AUNT MARGE,He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.
AUNT MARGE,Is that my Dudders?
AUNT MARGE,Is that my little neffy-pooh?
AUNT MARGE,"Give us a kiss. Come on. Up, up."
UNCLE VERNON,Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.
Harry Potter,Okay.
AUNT MARGE,Finish that off for Mommy.
AUNT MARGE,"Good boy, Rippy-pooh."
UNCLE VERNON,"Can I tempt you, Marge?"
AUNT MARGE,Just a small one.
AUNT MARGE,"Excellent nosh, Petunia."
AUNT MARGE,A bit more.
AUNT MARGE,"Usually just a fry-up for me, what with 12 dogs."
AUNT MARGE,Just a bit more. That's a boy.
AUNT MARGE,You wanna try a little drop of brandy?
AUNT MARGE,A little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?
AUNT MARGE,What are you smirking at?
AUNT MARGE,"Where did you send the boy, Vernon?"
UNCLE VERNON,St. Brutus'. It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.
AUNT MARGE,"Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy?"
Harry Potter,"Oh, yeah."
Harry Potter,Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times.
AUNT MARGE,Excellent. I won't have this namby-pamby...wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it.
AUNT MARGE,You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out.
AUNT MARGE,It's all to do with blood.
AUNT MARGE,Bad blood will out.
AUNT MARGE,"What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?"
AUNT PETUNIA,Nothing. He didn't work.
AUNT PETUNIA,He was unemployed.
AUNT MARGE,"And a drunk too, no doubt?"
Harry Potter,That's a lie.
AUNT MARGE,What did you say?
Harry Potter,My dad wasn't a drunk.
AUNT MARGE,"Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia."
AUNT MARGE,I have a very firm grip.
UNCLE VERNON,I think it's time you went to bed.
AUNT MARGE,"Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up."
AUNT MARGE,"Actually, it's nothing to do with the father."
AUNT MARGE,It's all to do with the mother.
AUNT MARGE,You see it all the time with dogs.
AUNT MARGE,"If something's wrong with the bitch, then something's wrong with the pup."
Harry Potter,Shut up! Shut up!
AUNT MARGE,Right.
AUNT MARGE,Let me tell you...
AUNT MARGE,"Vernon! Vernon! Vernon, do something!"
UNCLE VERNON,Stop!
UNCLE VERNON,"I've got you, Marge. I've got you."
UNCLE VERNON,"Hold on, hold on."
UNCLE VERNON,Get off.
AUNT MARGE,Don't you dare!
UNCLE VERNON,Sorry.
AUNT PETUNIA,"Oh, Vernon."
UNCLE VERNON,"Oh, God. Marge!"
UNCLE VERNON,Please! Marge! Come back!
UNCLE VERNON,You bring her back!
UNCLE VERNON,You bring her back now.
UNCLE VERNON,You put her right!
Harry Potter,No. She deserved what she got.
Harry Potter,Keep away from me.
UNCLE VERNON,You can't do magic outside school.
Harry Potter,Yeah? Try me.
UNCLE VERNON,They won't let you back now.
UNCLE VERNON,You've nowhere to go.
Harry Potter,I don't care.
Harry Potter,Anywhere is better than here.
STAN SHUNPIKE,Welcome to the Knight Bus...emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard.
"
STAN SHUNPIKE","	My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor for this evening."
STAN SHUNPIKE,What you doing down there?
Harry Potter,I fell over.
STAN SHUNPIKE,What you fall over for?
Harry Potter,I didn't do it on purpose.
STAN SHUNPIKE,"Well, come on, then."
STAN SHUNPIKE,Let's not wait for the grass to grow.
STAN SHUNPIKE,What you looking at?
Harry Potter,Nothing.
STAN SHUNPIKE,"Well, come on, then. In."
STAN SHUNPIKE,"No, no, no. I'll get this."
STAN SHUNPIKE,You get in.
STAN SHUNPIKE,"Come on. Come on. Move on, move on."
STAN SHUNPIKE,"Take her away, Ern."
SHRUNKEN HEAD,"Yeah, take it away, Ernie."
SHRUNKEN HEAD,It's going to be a bumpy ride.
STAN SHUNPIKE,What did you say your name was?
Harry Potter,I didn't.
STAN SHUNPIKE,Where abouts are you headed?
Harry Potter,he Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.
STAN SHUNPIKE,"You hear that? ""The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London."""
SHRUNKEN HEAD,The Leaky Cauldron.
SHRUNKEN HEAD,If you have pea soup make sure you eat it before it eats you.
Harry Potter,But the Muggles. Can't they see us?
STAN SHUNPIKE,"Muggles? They don't see nothing, do they?"
STAN SHUNPIKE,"No, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel."
SHRUNKEN HEAD,"Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!"
SHRUNKEN HEAD,"Ten, nine, eight...seven, six, five...four, three, three and a half...two, one and three quarters."
SHRUNKEN HEAD,Yes!
Harry Potter,Who is that? That man.
STAN SHUNPIKE,Who is that? Who is...?
STAN SHUNPIKE,"That is Sirius Black, that is."
STAN SHUNPIKE,Don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black.
STAN SHUNPIKE,He's a murderer.
STAN SHUNPIKE,Got himself locked up in Azkaban for it.
Harry Potter,How did he escape?
STAN SHUNPIKE,"Well, that's the question, isn't it?"
STAN SHUNPIKE,He's the first one that done it.
STAN SHUNPIKE,He was a big supporter of You-Know-Who.
STAN SHUNPIKE,I reckon you've heard of him.
Harry Potter,Yeah. Him I've heard of.
SHRUNKEN HEAD,"Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o'clock."
SHRUNKEN HEAD,"They're getting closer, Ernie."
SHRUNKEN HEAD,"Ernie, they're right on top of us!"
SHRUNKEN HEAD,Mind your head.
SHRUNKEN HEAD,"Hey, guys? Guys?"
SHRUNKEN HEAD,Why the long faces?
SHRUNKEN HEAD,"Yeah, yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there."
STAN SHUNPIKE,The Leaky Cauldron.
SHRUNKEN HEAD,"Next stop, Knockturn Alley."
TOM,"Mr. Potter, at last."
STAN SHUNPIKE,"Take it away, Ern."
SHRUNKEN HEAD,"Yeah, take it away, Ernie!"
TOM,Room 11.
Harry Potter,Hedwig.
TOM,"Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter."
TOM,He arrived here just five minutes before yourself.
FUDGE,"As Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack."
FUDGE,The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately.
FUDGE,She has been properly punctured and her memory modified.
FUDGE,She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever.
FUDGE,So that's that and no harm done.
FUDGE,Pea soup?
Harry Potter,"No, thank you. Minister?"
FUDGE,Yes?
Harry Potter,I don't understand.
FUDGE,Understand?
Harry Potter,I broke the law. Underage wizards can't use magic at home.
FUDGE,Come now Harry. The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts.
FUDGE,"On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things was very, very irresponsible."
Harry Potter,"The state of things, sir?"
FUDGE,We have a killer on the loose.
Harry Potter,"Sirius Black, you mean?"
Harry Potter,But what's he got to do with me?
FUDGE,"Nothing, of course. You're safe."
FUDGE,And that's what matters.
FUDGE,And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts.
FUDGE,These are your new schoolbooks.
FUDGE,I took the liberty of having them brought here.
FUDGE,Now Tom will show you to your room.
Harry Potter,Hedwig.
FUDGE,"Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't wander."
VENDOR,Right! You gonna move that bus or what?
HOUSEKEEPER,Housekeeping! I'll come back later.
Ron Weasley,"I'm warning you, Hermione."
Ron Weasley,"Keep that beast away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy."
Hermione Granger,"It's a cat, Ronald."
Hermione Granger,What do you expect?
Hermione Granger,It's in his nature.
Ron Weasley,A cat? Is that what they told you?
Ron Weasley,Looks like a pig with hair.
Hermione Granger,That's rich coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush.
Hermione Granger,"Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy."
Ron Weasley,Harry.
Hermione Granger,Harry.
Harry Potter,Egypt. What's it like?
Ron Weasley,"Brilliant. Loads of old stuff like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself."
Hermione Granger,Egyptians used to worship cats.
Ron Weasley,Along with the dung beetle.
GEORGE,Not flashing that clipping again?
Ron Weasley,I haven't shown anyone.
GEORGE,"No, not a soul."
FRED,Not unless you count Tom.
GEORGE,The day maid.
FRED,Night maid.
GEORGE,Cook.
FRED,The bloke who fixed the toilet.
MRS. WEASLEY,Harry.
Harry Potter,Mrs. Weasley.
MRS. WEASLEY,"Good to see you, dear."
Harry Potter,Good to see you too.
MRS. WEASLEY,Got everything?
Harry Potter,Yes.
MRS. WEASLEY,Yes? All your books?
Harry Potter,It's all upstairs.
MRS. WEASLEY,All of your clothes?
Harry Potter,Everything.
MRS. WEASLEY,Good boy.
Harry Potter,Thank you.
MR. WEASLEY,Harry Potter.
Harry Potter,Mr. Weasley.
MR. WEASLEY,"Harry, wonder if I might have a word?"
Harry Potter,"Yeah, sure."
MR. WEASLEY,Hermione.
Hermione Granger,"Good morning, Mr. Weasley."
MR. WEASLEY,Looking forward to a new term?
Harry Potter,Yeah. It should be great.
MR. WEASLEY,"Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you."
MR. WEASLEY,But I think that you need to know the facts.
MR. WEASLEY,You are in danger.
MR. WEASLEY,Grave danger.
Harry Potter,"Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?"
MR. WEASLEY,"What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?"
Harry Potter,Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
MR. WEASLEY,Do you know why?
MR. WEASLEY,"Thirteen years ago, when you stopped..."
Harry Potter,Voldemort.
MR. WEASLEY,Don't say his name.
Harry Potter,Sorry.
MR. WEASLEY,When you stopped You-Know-Who Black lost everything.
MR. WEASLEY,"But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant."
MR. WEASLEY,And in his mind you are the only thing that stands in the way of You-Know-Who returning to power.
MR. WEASLEY,And that is why he has escaped from Azkaban.
MR. WEASLEY,To find you.
Harry Potter,And kill me.
MR. WEASLEY,"Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear you won't go looking for Black."
Harry Potter,Mr. Weasley why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
MRS. WEASLEY,Quick. Quick.
MRS. WEASLEY,"Ron, Ron!"
MRS. WEASLEY,"Oh, for goodness' sake!"
MRS. WEASLEY,Don't lose him!
Harry Potter,I didn't mean to blow her up. I just...I lost control.
Ron Weasley,Brilliant.
Hermione Granger,"Honestly, Ron, it's not funny."
Hermione Granger,Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
Harry Potter,I was lucky not to be arrested actually.
Ron Weasley,I still think it was brilliant.
Hermione Granger,Come on. Everywhere else is full
Ron Weasley,Who do you think that is?
Hermione Granger,Professor R.J. Lupin.
Ron Weasley,Do you know everything?
Ron Weasley,How is it she knows everything?
Hermione Granger,"It's on his suitcase, Ronald."
Ron Weasley,Oh.
Harry Potter,Do you think he's really asleep?
Hermione Granger,Seems to be. Why?
Harry Potter,I gotta tell you something.
Ron Weasley,Let me get this straight.
Ron Weasley,Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come after you?
Harry Potter,Yeah.
Hermione Granger,"But they'll catch Black, won't they?"
Hermione Granger,"I mean, everyone's looking for him."
Ron Weasley,Sure.
Ron Weasley,"Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before and he's a murderous, raving lunatic."
Harry Potter,"Thanks, Ron."
Hermione Granger,Why are we stopping?
Hermione Granger,We can't be there yet.
Ron Weasley,What's going on?
Harry Potter,I don't know.
Harry Potter,Maybe we've broken down.
Hermione Granger,"Ouch, Ron. That was my foot."
Ron Weasley,There's something moving out there.
Ron Weasley,I think someone's coming aboard.
Ron Weasley,Bloody hell! What's happening?
Hermione Granger,Harry.
Hermione Granger,"Harry, are you all right?"
Harry Potter,Thank you.
LUPIN,"Here, eat this. It'll help."
LUPIN,It's all right. It's chocolate.
Harry Potter,What was that thing that came?
LUPIN,It was a dementor. 
LUPIN,One of the guards of Azkaban. It's gone now.
LUPIN,It was searching the train for Sirius Black.
LUPIN,"If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver."
LUPIN,Eat. You'll feel better.
Harry Potter,What happened to me?
Ron Weasley,"Well, you sort of went rigid."
Ron Weasley,We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.
Harry Potter,And did either of you two you know pass out?
Ron Weasley,No.
Ron Weasley,"I felt weird, though."
Ron Weasley,Like I'd never be cheerful again.
Harry Potter,But someone was screaming.
Harry Potter,A woman.
Hermione Granger,"No one was screaming, Harry."
Albus Dumbledore,Welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts.
Albus Dumbledore,"Now, I'd like to say a few words before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast."
Albus Dumbledore,"First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin who's kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher."
Albus Dumbledore,"Good luck, professor."
Hermione Granger,"Of course. That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry."
Draco Malfoy,Potter. Is it true you fainted?
Draco Malfoy,"I mean, you actually fainted?"
Ron Weasley,"Shove off, Malfoy."
Harry Potter,How did he find out?
Hermione Granger,Just forget it.
Albus Dumbledore,Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.
Albus Dumbledore,"Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce that his place will be taken by none other than our own Rubeus Hagrid."
Albus Dumbledore,"Finally, on a more disquieting note at the request of the Ministry of Magic "
Albus Dumbledore,"Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban until such a time as Sirius Black is captured."
Albus Dumbledore,The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds.
Albus Dumbledore,Now whilst I've been assured that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities a word of caution.
Albus Dumbledore,Dementors are vicious creatures.
Albus Dumbledore,They'll not distinguish between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way.
Albus Dumbledore,"Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you."
Albus Dumbledore,It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.
Albus Dumbledore,"But you know, happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light."
SEAMUS,Fortuna Major.
SEAMUS,"Here, listen."
SEAMUS,She just won't let me in.
Harry Potter,Fortuna Major.
FAT LADY,"No, no. Wait, wait."
FAT LADY,Watch this.
FAT LADY,Amazing. Just with my voice.
Harry Potter,Fortuna Major.
FAT LADY,"Yes, all right. Go in."
Harry Potter,Thank you.
Harry Potter,Still doing that after three years.
Harry Potter,She can't even sing.
SEAMUS,Exactly.
Harry Potter,"Hey, man."
SEAMUS,"Hey, man."
DEAN,"Oh, God."
Hermione Granger,That's awful.
Ron Weasley,Green. That's a monkey.
Ron Weasley,What is that?
DEAN,You call that a monkey?
Ron Weasley,Do not give him one again.
Ron Weasley,"Hey, Neville, try an elephant."
SEAMUS,"Ron, catch."
Ron Weasley,I will.
SEAMUS,I think we have a winner.
Ron Weasley,"Oh, don't try one of them."
SEAMUS,"Oh, no."
Ron Weasley,Look at him. His face.
TRELAWNEY,"Welcome, my children."
TRELAWNEY,"In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination."
TRELAWNEY,"In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight."
TRELAWNEY,Hello. I am Professor Trelawney.
TRELAWNEY,Together we shall cast ourselves into the future.
TRELAWNEY,"This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves."
TRELAWNEY,"So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you."
TRELAWNEY,What do you see?
TRELAWNEY,"The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read."
TRELAWNEY,"But first, you must broaden your minds."
TRELAWNEY,"First, you must look beyond."
Hermione Granger,What a load of rubbish.
Ron Weasley,Where did you come from?
Hermione Granger,Me?
Hermione Granger,I've been here all this time.
TRELAWNEY,"You, boy..."
TRELAWNEY,Is your grandmother quite well?
NEVILLE,I think so.
TRELAWNEY,I wouldn't be so sure of that.
TRELAWNEY,Give me the cup.
TRELAWNEY,Pity.
TRELAWNEY,Broaden your minds.
TRELAWNEY,"Your aura is pulsing, dear."
TRELAWNEY,Are you in the beyond?
TRELAWNEY,I think you are.
Ron Weasley,Sure.
TRELAWNEY,Look at the cup.
TRELAWNEY,Tell me what you see.
Ron Weasley,Yeah.
Ron Weasley,Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
Ron Weasley,That's trials and suffering.
Ron Weasley,And that there could be the sun and that's happiness.
Ron Weasley,"So you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it."
TRELAWNEY,Give me the cup.
TRELAWNEY,"Oh, my dear boy."
TRELAWNEY,My dear you have the Grim.
SEAMUS,The Grin? What's the Grin?
BEM,"Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim."
BEM,Taking form of a giant spectral dog.
BEM,It's among the darkest omens in our world.
BEM,"It's an omen of death."""
Ron Weasley,You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?
Hermione Granger,"Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline."
Hermione Granger,"Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject."
Ron Weasley,Ancient Runes? Exactly how many classes are you taking?
Hermione Granger,A fair few.
Ron Weasley,Hang on. That's not possible.
Ron Weasley,Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination.
Ron Weasley,You have to be in two classes at once.
Hermione Granger,Don't be silly. How could anyone be in two classes at once?
Hermione Granger,Broaden your minds. Use your Inner Eye to see the future.
Rubeus Hagrid,"That's it. Come on, now. Come closer."
Rubeus Hagrid,"Less talking, if you don't mind."
Rubeus Hagrid,I got a real treat for you today.
Rubeus Hagrid,A great lesson. So follow me.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Right, you lot. Less chattering."
Rubeus Hagrid,Form a group over there.
Rubeus Hagrid,And open your books to page 49.
Draco Malfoy,Exactly how do we do that?
Rubeus Hagrid,"Just stroke the spine, of course."
Rubeus Hagrid,Goodness me.
Draco Malfoy,"Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom."
NEVILLE,I'm okay. Okay.
Hermione Granger,I think they're funny.
Draco Malfoy,"Oh, yeah. Terribly funny."
Draco Malfoy,"Witty. God, this place has gone to the dogs."
Draco Malfoy,Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.
Harry Potter,"Shut up, Malfoy."
Draco Malfoy,Dementor! Dementor!
Hermione Granger,Just ignore him.
Ron Weasley,You're supposed to stroke it.
NEVILLE,Yeah.
Hermione Granger,Tah- tah- tah- dah! Isn't he beautiful?
Hermione Granger,Say hello to Buckbeak.
Ron Weasley,"Hagrid, exactly what is that?"
Rubeus Hagrid,"That, Ron, is a hippogriff."
Rubeus Hagrid,First thing you wanna know is they're very proud creatures.
Rubeus Hagrid,Very easily offended.
Rubeus Hagrid,You do not want to insult a hippogriff.
Rubeus Hagrid,It may be the last thing you ever do.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Now, who'd like to come and say hello?"
Rubeus Hagrid,"Well done, Harry. Well done."
Rubeus Hagrid,Come on now.
Rubeus Hagrid,Now you have to let him make the first move. 
Rubeus Hagrid,It's only polite. So step up. Give him a nice bow.
Rubeus Hagrid,Then you wait and see if he bows back.
Rubeus Hagrid,"If he does, you can go and touch him."
Rubeus Hagrid,"If not... Well, we'll get to that later."
Rubeus Hagrid,Just make your bow.
Rubeus Hagrid,Nice and low.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Back off, Harry. Back off."
Rubeus Hagrid,Keep still. Keep still.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Well done, Harry. Well done."
Rubeus Hagrid,"Here, you big brute, you."
Rubeus Hagrid,Right. I think you can go and pat him now.
Rubeus Hagrid,Go on. Don't be shy.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Nice and slow, now."
Rubeus Hagrid,Nice and slow. Slow.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Not so fast, Harry."
Rubeus Hagrid,"Slow down, Harry. That's it..."
Rubeus Hagrid,Nice and slow.
Rubeus Hagrid,Now let him come to you.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Slowly, now, slowly, slowly..."
Rubeus Hagrid,That's itâ€¦Yes!
Rubeus Hagrid,"Well done! Well done, Harry,"
Rubeus Hagrid,well done!
BEM,Does he get to fly?
Rubeus Hagrid,I think he may let you ride him now.
Harry Potter,What?
Rubeus Hagrid,Come on.
Harry Potter,"Hey, hey, hey!"
Rubeus Hagrid,"Put you over here, just behind the wing joint. "
Rubeus Hagrid,"Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that."
Rubeus Hagrid,"Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak."
Hermione Granger,"That was wicked, Harry!"
Draco Malfoy,"Oh, please."
Rubeus Hagrid,"Well done, well done."
Rubeus Hagrid,How am I doing me first day?
Harry Potter,"Brilliant, professor."
Draco Malfoy,"You're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!"
Rubeus Hagrid,"Malfoy, no..."
Rubeus Hagrid,No!
Rubeus Hagrid,Buckbeak!
Rubeus Hagrid,"Whoa, whoa, whoa..."
Rubeus Hagrid,Whoa! Buckbeak!
Rubeus Hagrid,"Away, you silly creature..."
Draco Malfoy,It's killed me!
Rubeus Hagrid,Calm down. It's just a scratch!
Hermione Granger,Hagrid! He has to be taken to the hospital.
Rubeus Hagrid,I'm the teacher. I'll do it.
Draco Malfoy,You're gonna regret this.
Rubeus Hagrid,Class dismissed!
Draco Malfoy,You and your bloody chicken!
PANSY PARKINSON,"Does it hurt terribly, Draco?"
Draco Malfoy,It comes and it goes.
Draco Malfoy,"Still, I consider myself lucky."
Draco Malfoy,Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm.
Draco Malfoy,I can't do homework for weeks.
Ron Weasley,Listen to the idiot.
Ron Weasley,"He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?"
Harry Potter,At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
Hermione Granger,I hear Draco's father's furious.
Hermione Granger,We haven't heard the end of this.
SEAMUS,He's been sighted!
Ron Weasley,Who?
SEAMUS,Sirius Black!
Hermione Granger,Dufftown? That's not far from here.
NEVILLE,"You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you?"
BOY,With dementors at every entrance?
SEAMUS,Dementors?
SEAMUS,He slipped past them once.
SEAMUS,Who's to say he won't do it again?
BEM,That's right. Black could be anywhere.
BEM,It's like trying to catch smoke.
BEM,Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.
LUPIN,"Intriguing, isn't it?"
LUPIN,Would anyone like to venture a guess as to what is inside?
DEAN,"That's a boggart, that is."
LUPIN,"Very good, Mr. Thomas."
LUPIN,"Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?"
Hermione Granger,No one knows.
Ron Weasley,When did she get here?
Hermione Granger,Boggarts are shape-shifters.
Hermione Granger,They take the shape of whatever a person fears the most.
Hermione Granger,That's what makes them so...
LUPIN,"So terrifying, yes, yes, yes..."
LUPIN,"Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart."
LUPIN,Let's practice it now.
LUPIN,"Without wands, please."
LUPIN,After me. Riddikulus!
CLASS,Riddikulus!
LUPIN,Very good.
LUPIN,A little louder and very clear.
LUPIN,Listen: Riddikulus!
CLASS,Riddikulus!
Draco Malfoy,This class is ridiculous.
LUPIN,Very good.
LUPIN,So much for the easy part. 
LUPIN,"You see, the incantation alone is not enough."
LUPIN,What really finishes a boggart is laughter.
LUPIN,You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing. 
LUPIN,"Let me explain. Neville, would you join me, please?"
LUPIN,"Come on, don't be shy. Come on."
LUPIN,Come on.
LUPIN,"Hello. Neville, what frightens you most of all?"
NEVILLE,Professor Snape.
LUPIN,Sorry?
NEVILLE,Professor Snape.
LUPIN,"Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all."
LUPIN,You live with your grandmother.
NEVILLE,"Yes. I don't want it to turn into her, either."
LUPIN,No it won't. I want you to picture her clothes.
LUPIN,"Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind."
NEVILLE,She carries a red handbag...
LUPIN,We don't need to hear.
LUPIN,"As long as you see it, we'll see it."
LUPIN,"Now, when I open that wardrobe here's what I want you to do. Excuse me."
LUPIN,Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes.
LUPIN,Can you do that?
LUPIN,Yes. Wand at the ready.
LUPIN,"One, two, three."
LUPIN,"Think, Neville, think."
NEVILLE,Riddikulus!
LUPIN,"Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!"
LUPIN,"Incredible! Okay to the back, Neville."
LUPIN,"Everyone, form a line..."
LUPIN,Form a line!
LUPIN,I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most and turn it into something funny.
LUPIN,Next! Ron!
LUPIN,Concentrate. Face your fear.
LUPIN,Be brave!
LUPIN,"Wand at the ready, Ron."
Ron Weasley,Riddikulus!
LUPIN,Yes!
LUPIN,"You see? Very good, very good!"
LUPIN,"Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very enjoyable! Parvati! Next!"
LUPIN,Show us what you see.
LUPIN,Keep your nerve. Steady.
PARVATI,Riddikulus!
LUPIN,"And next! Step up, step up!"
LUPIN,"Wonderful, wonderful! Here!"
LUPIN,Riddikulus!
LUPIN,Right. Sorry about that.
LUPIN,That's enough for today.
LUPIN,Collect your books from the back.
LUPIN,That's the end of the lesson.
LUPIN,Thank you! Sorry!
LUPIN,"Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing."
Minerva McGonagall,"Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege."
Minerva McGonagall,Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school that privilege shall not be extended again.
Minerva McGonagall,"No permission form signed, no visiting the village."
Minerva McGonagall,"That's the rule, Potter."
FILCH,"Those with permission, follow me."
FILCH,"Those without, stay put."
Harry Potter,"I thought if you signed it, then I could..."
Minerva McGonagall,I can't. Only a parent or a guardian can sign.
Minerva McGonagall,"Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate."
Minerva McGonagall,"I'm sorry, Potter."
Minerva McGonagall,That's my final word.
Harry Potter,"Forget about it, guys. See you later."
Harry Potter,"Professor, can I ask you something?"
LUPIN,"You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes?"
LUPIN,I thought it'd be obvious.
LUPIN,I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.
Harry Potter,I did think of Voldemort at first.
Harry Potter,But then I remembered that night on the train and the dementor.
LUPIN,I'm very impressed.
LUPIN,That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself.
LUPIN,This is very wise.
Harry Potter,Before I fainted I heard something.
Harry Potter,A woman screaming.
LUPIN,Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories.
LUPIN,Our pain becomes their power.
Harry Potter,I think it was my mother the night she was murdered.
LUPIN,"The very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately."
LUPIN,"Not by your scar, by your eyes."
LUPIN,"They're your mother, Lily's."
LUPIN,"Yes. Oh, yes. I knew her."
LUPIN,Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was.
LUPIN,Not only was she a singularly gifted witch she was also an uncommonly kind woman.
LUPIN,"She had a way of seeing the beauty in others even, and most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves."
LUPIN,"And your father, James, on the other hand he..."
LUPIN,"He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble."
LUPIN,"A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you."
LUPIN,"You're more like them than you know, Harry."
LUPIN,"In time, you'll come to see just how much."
Ron Weasley,"Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop."
Ron Weasley,We never got to go to the Shrieking Shack.
Ron Weasley,You heard it's the most...
Harry Potter,Haunted building in Britain. I know.
Harry Potter,What's going on?
Ron Weasley,Probably Neville forgot the password again.
NEVILLE,Hey.
Ron Weasley,"Oh, you're there."
PERCY,"Let me through, please."
PERCY,Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!
PERCY,"Get back, all of you."
PERCY,No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched.
GINNY,The Fat Lady! She's gone!
Ron Weasley,Serves her right.
Ron Weasley,She was a terrible singer.
Hermione Granger,"It's not funny, Ron."
PERCY,"Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours."
PERCY,Back to your common room.
PERCY,Be quiet. Make way.
PERCY,The headmaster's here.
FILCH,"Come on, move."
PERCY,You heard. Move!
Albus Dumbledore,Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.
Albus Dumbledore,Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
FILCH,"There's no need for ghosts, professor."
FILCH,The Fat Lady's there.
PERCY,Mind where you're going! Slow down!
PERCY,You listen! I'm Head Boy!
PERCY,Come back here!
Albus Dumbledore,Keep moving!
Albus Dumbledore,"Dear lady, who did this to you?"
FAT LADY,"Eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name."
FAT LADY,"It's him, headmaster."
FAT LADY,The one they all talk about.
FAT LADY,"He's here, somewhere in the castle!"
FAT LADY,Sirius Black!
Albus Dumbledore,"Secure the castle, Mr. Filch."
Albus Dumbledore,"The rest of you, to the Great Hall."
FILCH,I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery. 
FILCH,There's nothing there.
Albus Dumbledore,Thank you.
TEACHER,"The third floor's clear too, sir."
Albus Dumbledore,Very good.
Severus Snape,I've done the dungeons.
Severus Snape,"No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle."
Albus Dumbledore,I didn't really expect him to linger.
Severus Snape,"Remarkable feat, don't you think?"
Severus Snape,To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own completely undetected?
Albus Dumbledore,"Quite remarkable, yes."
Severus Snape,Any theories on how he managed it?
Albus Dumbledore,Many. Each as unlikely as the next.
Severus Snape,You may recall prior to the start of term I expressed concerns about your appointment of Professor...
Albus Dumbledore,Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it.
Albus Dumbledore,I'm quite convinced the castle is safe and I'm more than willing to send the students to their houses.
Severus Snape,What about Potter?
Severus Snape,Should he be warned?
Albus Dumbledore,"Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep."
Albus Dumbledore,"For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own."
Albus Dumbledore,Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.
Severus Snape,Turn to page 394.
Harry Potter,"Excuse me, sir."
Harry Potter,Where's Professor Lupin?
Severus Snape,"That's not really your concern, is it, Potter?"
Severus Snape,Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time.
Severus Snape,Turn to page 394.
Ron Weasley,Werewolves?
Hermione Granger,"Sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks."
Hermione Granger,We're not meant to start that for weeks.
Severus Snape,Quiet.
Ron Weasley,When did she come in?
Ron Weasley,Did you see her come in?
Severus Snape,"Now, which one of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf?"
Severus Snape,No one?
Severus Snape,How disappointing.
Hermione Granger,"Please, sir."
Hermione Granger,An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.
Hermione Granger,A werewolf has no choice.
Hermione Granger,With each full moon he no longer remembers who he is.
Hermione Granger,He'd kill his best friend.
Hermione Granger,"Furthermore, The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind."
Severus Snape,"Thank you, Mr. Malfoy."
Severus Snape,"That's the second time you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger."
Severus Snape,Are you incapable of restraining yourself or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
Ron Weasley,"He's got a point, you know."
Severus Snape,Five points from Gryffindor.
Severus Snape,"As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis on recognizing it."
Harry Potter,It's Quidditch tomorrow.
Severus Snape,"Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter."
Severus Snape,Loss of limb will not excuse you.
Severus Snape,Page 394.
Severus Snape,"The term ""werewolf"" is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word ""were"" which means ""man,"" and ""wolf."" Werewolf, man-wolf."
Severus Snape,There are several ways to become a werewolf.
Severus Snape,They include being given the power of shape-shifting being bitten by a werewolf...
CROWD,Go Go Gryffindor!!
Hermione Granger,"Go, Harry! Go, Harry!"
Albus Dumbledore,Aresto momentum!
Ron Weasley,"He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?"
FRED,Peaky?
FRED,What do you expect?
FRED,He fell over 100 feet.
GEORGE,Let's walk you off a tower and see what you look like.
Harry Potter,Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
Hermione Granger,How are you feeling?
Harry Potter,"Oh, brilliant."
GEORGE,You gave us a right good scare.
Harry Potter,What happened?
Ron Weasley,"Well, you fell off your broom."
Harry Potter,Really? I meant the match. Who won?
Hermione Granger,"No one blames you, Harry."
Hermione Granger,Dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.
Hermione Granger,"After he saved you, he sent them off."
Ron Weasley,There's something else you should know too.
Ron Weasley,"When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and...Well..."
LUPIN,I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.
LUPIN,Is there no chance of fixing it?
Harry Potter,No.
Harry Potter,"Professor, why do the dementors affect me so?"
Harry Potter,"I mean, more than everyone else?"
LUPIN,Listen.
LUPIN,Dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth.
LUPIN,"They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences."
LUPIN,"You are not weak, Harry."
LUPIN,Dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past.
LUPIN,Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine.
LUPIN,You have nothing to be ashamed of.
Harry Potter,"I'm scared, professor."
LUPIN,"Well, I'd consider you a fool if you weren't."
Harry Potter,I need to know how to fight them.
Harry Potter,You could teach me.
Harry Potter,You made the one on the train go away.
LUPIN,There was only one that night.
Harry Potter,But you made it go away.
LUPIN,"I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry."
LUPIN,But as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you perhaps I should teach you.
LUPIN,But after the holidays.
LUPIN,"For now, I need to rest."
MAN,Last call for Hogsmeade!
MAN,"Come on, now!"
Harry Potter,"Guys, let me go."
FRED,"Clever, Harry."
GEORGE,But not clever enough.
FRED,We've got a better way.
Harry Potter,I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
FRED & GEORGE,We know.
FRED,We'll get you there.
GEORGE,We'll show you a quicker way.
FRED,If you pipe down.
FRED,Bless him.
Harry Potter,"Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't..."
FRED,"Now, Harry."
GEORGE,Come and join the big boys.
Harry Potter,What are you doing?!
Harry Potter,What's this rubbish?
GEORGE,What's this rubbish? he says.
FRED,It's the secret to our success.
GEORGE,It's a wrench giving it to you...
FRED,But we've decided your needs are greater than ours.
FRED,"George, if you will."
GEORGE,I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
Harry Potter,"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are proud to present the Marauder's Map."
GEORGE,We owe them so much.
Harry Potter,Hang on. This is Hogwarts. And thatâ€¦
Harry Potter,No. Is that really...?
FRED,Dumbledore.
GEORGE,In his study.
FRED,Pacing.
GEORGE,Does that a lot.
Harry Potter,So you mean this map shows...
FRED,Everyone.
Harry Potter,Everyone?
GEORGE,Where they are.
FRED,What they're doing.
GEORGE,Every minute.
FRED,Every day.
Harry Potter,Brilliant! Where did you get it?
FRED,From Filch's office.
FRED,First year.
GEORGE,There are seven secret passageways out of the castle.
GEORGE,We'd recommend this one.
FRED,The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
GEORGE,Leads straight you to Honeyduke's.
FRED,Hurry. Filch is heading this way.
GEORGE,"Oh Harry and don't forget. When you're done, just give it a tap and say:"
FRED & GEORGE,Mischief managed.
FRED & GEORGE,"Otherwise, anyone can read it."
WITCH,"Now, how much do you want?"
BOY,Delicious.
Hermione Granger,It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that?
Ron Weasley,Twice.
Hermione Granger,Do you want to move a bit closer?
Hermione Granger,To the Shrieking Shack?
Ron Weasley,"Actually, I'm fine here."
Draco Malfoy,"Well, well. Look who's here."
Draco Malfoy,You two shopping for your new dream home?
Draco Malfoy,"Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?"
Draco Malfoy,Don't your family sleep in one room?
Ron Weasley,"Shut your mouth, Malfoy."
Draco Malfoy,Not very friendly.
Draco Malfoy,"Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors."
Hermione Granger,Hope you don't mean yourself.
Draco Malfoy,How dare you talk to me!
Draco Malfoy,You filthy little mudblood!
Draco Malfoy,Who is that?
Draco Malfoy,Don't stand there! Do something!
CRABBE,What?
Ron Weasley,"What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?"
Draco Malfoy,Get out of the way!
Draco Malfoy,Move!
CRABBE,Malfoy! Wait! Wait!
Hermione Granger,Harry!
Ron Weasley,"Bloody hell, Harry."
Ron Weasley,That was not funny.
Ron Weasley,Those weasels! Never told me about any Marauder's Map.
Hermione Granger,He won't keep it. He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall. Aren't you?
Ron Weasley,Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.
Hermione Granger,Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.
Hermione Granger,Ron fancies her.
Ron Weasley,That's not true!
FUDGE,Professor McGonagall!
Minerva McGonagall,Cornelius!
Rubeus Hagrid,"Allow me, minister."
FUDGE,"Oh, Hagrid..."
Rubeus Hagrid,Sorry about that.
FUDGE,"Rosmerta, my dear."
FUDGE,I hope business is good.
MADAM ROSMERTA,It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors into my pub every other night!
FUDGE,We have...We have a killer on the loose.
MADAM ROSMERTA,Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!
MADAM ROSMERTA,And what would bring him here?
FUDGE,Harry Potter.
MADAM ROSMERTA,Harry Potter?
FUDGE,Shh! Come.
Hermione Granger,Harry!
SHRUNKEN HEAD 1,No underage wizards allowed in today!
SHRUNKEN HEAD 2,Shut the damn door!
Hermione Granger,So rude.
Ron Weasley,Thick heads.
SHRUNKEN HEAD 1,Thick heads?!
SHRUNKEN HEAD 2,How dare they!
SHRUNKEN HEAD 2,Who are they calling thick heads?
SHRUNKEN HEAD 1,Young whippersnappers!
MADAM ROSMERTA,Nobody will come to a pub where they'll get scared out of their wits.
Minerva McGonagall,Professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place.
MADAM ROSMERTA,Tell me what this is all about.
Minerva McGonagall,"Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death..."
Minerva McGonagall,Remember? They hid.
Minerva McGonagall,Few knew where they were.
Minerva McGonagall,One who did was Sirius Black.
Minerva McGonagall,And he told You-Know-Who.
FUDGE,Not only did Black lead him to the Potters that night he also killed one of their friends Peter Pettigrew!
MADAM ROSMERTA,Peter Pettigrew?
Minerva McGonagall,Little lump of a boy.
Minerva McGonagall,Always trailing after Black.
MADAM ROSMERTA,I remember.
MADAM ROSMERTA,Never let James and Sirius out of his sight.
MADAM ROSMERTA,What happened?
Minerva McGonagall,"Peter tried to warn the Potters and might have, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black."
FUDGE,Black was vicious.
FUDGE,He didn't kill Pettigrew. He destroyed him!
FUDGE,A finger. That's all that was left.
FUDGE,A finger. Nothing else.
Minerva McGonagall,"Yes, Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters but he's the reason they're dead."
FUDGE,And now he wants to finish what he started.
MADAM ROSMERTA,I don't believe it.
FUDGE,That's not the worst of it.
MADAM ROSMERTA,What could be worse?
Minerva McGonagall,This: Sirius Black was and remains to this day Harry Potter's godfather!
Hermione Granger,"Ron, look!"
Hermione Granger,"Sorry. Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me."
Ron Weasley,Merry Christmas.
Hermione Granger,"Harry, what happened?"
Harry Potter,He was their friend and he betrayed them.
Harry Potter,He was their friend!
Harry Potter,I hope he finds me.
Harry Potter,"Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready!"
Harry Potter,"When he does, I'm gonna kill him!"
LUPIN,Harry. There you are. You came.
LUPIN,"Are you sure about this, Harry?"
LUPIN,This is very advanced magic well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level.
Harry Potter,I'm sure.
LUPIN,"Well, everything's prepared."
LUPIN,The spell I'm going to try yo teach you is called the Patronus Charm.
LUPIN,Did you ever hear of it?
LUPIN,No? Well...A Patronus is a positive force.
LUPIN,"For the wizard who conjures one it works like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him."
LUPIN,"But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory."
LUPIN,"Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory."
LUPIN,Can you do this?
Harry Potter,Yes.
LUPIN,Very well. Close your eyes.
LUPIN,Concentrate.
LUPIN,Explore your past.
LUPIN,Do you have a memory?
LUPIN,Allow it to fill you up.
LUPIN,Lose yourself within it.
LUPIN,"Then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum."
Harry Potter,Expecto Patronum.
LUPIN,Very good.
Harry Potter,Shall we? Wand at the ready.
Harry Potter,Expecto Patronum!
Harry Potter,Expecto... Expecto...Expect...
LUPIN,Here we go. Come on.
LUPIN,Sit up. Deep breaths.
LUPIN,It's all right. I didn't expect you to do it the first time.
LUPIN,That would have been remarkable.
LUPIN,"Here, eat this. You'll feel better."
Harry Potter,That's one nasty dementor.
LUPIN,"Oh, no, no, no."
LUPIN,"That was a boggart, Harry. A boggart."
LUPIN,The real thing would be worse.
LUPIN,"Much, much worse."
LUPIN,"As a matter of interest, what were you thinking?"
LUPIN,Which memory did you choose?
Harry Potter,The first time I rode a broom.
LUPIN,That's not good enough.
LUPIN,Not nearly good enough.
Harry Potter,There's another.
Harry Potter,"It's not happy, exactly."
Harry Potter,"Well, it is."
Harry Potter,It's the happiest I've ever felt but it's complicated.
LUPIN,Is it strong?
LUPIN,Then let's give it a try. You feel ready?
Harry Potter,Just do it.
Harry Potter,Expecto Patronum!
Harry Potter,Expecto Patronum!
LUPIN,"Yes! Well done, Harry. Well done!"
Harry Potter,I think I've had enough for today.
LUPIN,Yes. Sit down. Here.
LUPIN,"Eat this, it helps. It really helps."
LUPIN,"And just so you know, Harry I think you'd have given your father a run for his money."
LUPIN,And that is saying something.
Harry Potter,I was thinking of him. And Mum.
Harry Potter,Seeing their faces.
Harry Potter,They were talking to me.
Harry Potter,Just talking.
Harry Potter,That's the memory I chose.
Harry Potter,I don't even know if it's real.
Harry Potter,But it's the best I have.
Hermione Granger,Beautiful day.
Ron Weasley,Gorgeous.
Ron Weasley,Unless you've been ripped to pieces!
Harry Potter,Ripped to pieces?
Harry Potter,What are you talking about?
Hermione Granger,Ronald has lost his rat.
Ron Weasley,I haven't lost anything!
Ron Weasley,Your cat killed him!
Hermione Granger,Rubbish.
Ron Weasley,"Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers is always lurking about."
Ron Weasley,And Scabbers is gone.
Hermione Granger,"Well, maybe you should learn to take better care of your pets!"
Ron Weasley,Your cat killed him!
Hermione Granger,Did not.
Ron Weasley,Did.
Hermione Granger,Didn't.
Hermione Granger,"How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?"
Rubeus Hagrid,"Well, first off, the committee members took turns talking about why we were there."
Rubeus Hagrid,I got up and did my piece.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Said how Buckbeak was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers."
Rubeus Hagrid,And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Well, you can imagine."
Rubeus Hagrid,He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature who would kill you as soon as look at you.
Hermione Granger,And then?
Rubeus Hagrid,"And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius."
Ron Weasley,They're not sacking you!
Rubeus Hagrid,"No, I'm not sacked."
Rubeus Hagrid,Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!
Ron Weasley,Spiders! There's... There's spiders.
Ron Weasley,Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.
Ron Weasley,I don't wanna tap-dance!
Harry Potter,Tell those spiders.
Ron Weasley,"Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them..."
MADAM ROSMERTA,Peter Pettigrew?
Minerva McGonagall,Little lump of a boy.
Minerva McGonagall,Always trailing after Sirius Black.
FUDGE,Black was vicious.
FUDGE,"He didn 't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him!"
VOICE,Put that light out!
Harry Potter,Sorry.
VOICE,"Watch it there, boy."
VOICE,We're trying to sleep here!
Harry Potter,Mischief managed. Nox.
Severus Snape,Potter.
Severus Snape,What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
Harry Potter,I was sleepwalking.
Severus Snape,"How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter."
Severus Snape,"He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle."
Harry Potter,My dad didn't strut. And nor do I.
Harry Potter,"If you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand."
Severus Snape,Turn out your pockets.
Severus Snape,Turn out your pockets!
Severus Snape,What's this?
Harry Potter,Spare bit of parchment.
Severus Snape,Really? Open it.
Severus Snape,Reveal your secrets.
Severus Snape,Read it.
Harry Potter,"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs offer their compliments to Professor Snape and..."
Severus Snape,Go on.
Harry Potter,And request he keep his large nose out of other people's business.
Severus Snape,You insolent little...
LUPIN,Professor!
Severus Snape,"Well, well. Lupin."
Severus Snape,"Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?"
LUPIN,"Harry, are you all right?"
Severus Snape,That remains to be seen.
Severus Snape,I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact.
Severus Snape,"Take a look, Lupin."
Severus Snape,Supposed to be your area of expertise.
Severus Snape,"Clearly, it's full of dark magic."
LUPIN,"I seriously doubt it, Severus."
LUPIN,It looks as though it's a parchment designed to insult anyone who tries to read it.
LUPIN,I suspect it's a Zonko product.
LUPIN,"Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess."
LUPIN,"It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise."
LUPIN,"Harry, would you come with me, please? Professor, good night."
VOICE,Are you deaf? Put that light out!
LUPIN,Come in.
LUPIN,"I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in."
LUPIN,"Did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black is a map to you?"
LUPIN,No.
Harry Potter,"No, sir."
LUPIN,Your father never set much store by the rules either.
LUPIN,But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours.
LUPIN,Gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them!
LUPIN,"Now, I will not cover up for you again."
LUPIN,Do you hear me?
Harry Potter,"Yes, sir."
LUPIN,I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there.
LUPIN,And don't take any detours.
LUPIN,"If you do, I shall know."
Harry Potter,"Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works."
Harry Potter,"Earlier, it showed someone in the castle."
Harry Potter,Someone I know to be dead.
LUPIN,"Oh, really? And who might that be?"
Harry Potter,Peter Pettigrew.
LUPIN,That's not possible.
Harry Potter,It's just what I saw.
Harry Potter,"Good night, professor."
TRELAWNEY,Broaden your minds.
TRELAWNEY,You must look beyond.
TRELAWNEY,The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.
TRELAWNEY,Only then can you see. Try again.
TRELAWNEY,"Now, what do we have here?"
Hermione Granger,Do you mind me trying?
Hermione Granger,"The Grim, possibly."
TRELAWNEY,"My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit for the noble art of Divination."
TRELAWNEY,"No, you see, there."
TRELAWNEY,"You may be young in years, but your heart is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books to which you so desperately cleave."
TRELAWNEY,Have I said something?
Ron Weasley,"She's gone mental, Hermione has."
Ron Weasley,"I mean, not that she wasn't always mental but now it's in the open for everyone to see."
Harry Potter,Hang on.
Harry Potter,We better take this back.
Ron Weasley,I'm not going back.
Harry Potter,Fine. See you later.
Ron Weasley,See you.
VOICE,Harry Potter
Harry Potter,Professor Trelawney...
TRELAWNEY,He will return tonight.
Harry Potter,Sorry?
TRELAWNEY,"Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder shall break free."
TRELAWNEY,Innocent blood shall be spilt and servant and master shall be reunited once more.
TRELAWNEY,"I'm so sorry, dear boy."
TRELAWNEY,Did you say something?
Harry Potter,No. Nothing.
Hermione Granger,I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.
Ron Weasley,It just got worse.
Draco Malfoy,What did I say? Father said I can keep the hippogriff's head.
Draco Malfoy,I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.
Draco Malfoy,This is going to be rich.
GOYLE,Look who's here.
Draco Malfoy,Come to see the show?
Hermione Granger,"You! You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!"
Ron Weasley,"Hermione, no!"
Ron Weasley,He's not worth it.
GOYLE,"Malfoy, are you okay?"
GOYLE,Let's go. Quick.
Draco Malfoy,"Not a word to anyone, understood?"
Hermione Granger,That felt good.
Ron Weasley,"Not good, brilliant."
Rubeus Hagrid,Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.
Harry Potter,Why don't we just set him free?
Rubeus Hagrid,"They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore would get into trouble."
Rubeus Hagrid,"He's coming down, Dumbledore."
Rubeus Hagrid,Says he wants to be with me when they...When it happens.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Great man, Dumbledore."
Rubeus Hagrid,A great man.
Hermione Granger,We'll stay with you too.
Rubeus Hagrid,You'll do no such thing!
Rubeus Hagrid,Think I want you seeing something like that? No.
Rubeus Hagrid,You just drink your tea and be off.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Oh. Before you do, Ron..."
Ron Weasley,Scabbers! You're alive!
Rubeus Hagrid,Keep a closer eye on your pet.
Hermione Granger,I think you owe someone an apology.
Ron Weasley,"Right. Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know."
Hermione Granger,I meant me!
Rubeus Hagrid,Blimey. What was that?
Harry Potter,Hagrid!
Rubeus Hagrid,"Oh, crikey."
Albus Dumbledore,"No, minister. Over this way."
Rubeus Hagrid,It's late. It's nearly dark.
Rubeus Hagrid,You shouldn't be here.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Someone sees you outside this time of night, you'll be in trouble."
Rubeus Hagrid,"Particularly you, Harry."
Rubeus Hagrid,With you in a moment!
Rubeus Hagrid,Quick. Quick!
Harry Potter,Hagrid.
Harry Potter,It'll be fine. It'll be okay.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Go on, go on!"
Albus Dumbledore,That's ling you see over there...
FUDGE,On the slope.
Albus Dumbledore,"On the slope... Ah, Hagrid."
Rubeus Hagrid,Professor Dumbledore.
Albus Dumbledore,Good evening.
Rubeus Hagrid,Minister. Make your way through.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Have a tea, if you like."
FUDGE,"No, Hagrid."
Rubeus Hagrid,Gentlemen.
Albus Dumbledore,I'd like a cup of tea.
FUDGE,"Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we?"
FUDGE,"Very well. It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak here in after called ""the condemned,"" shall be executed this day at sundown."
Rubeus Hagrid,"Dear, dear..."
Albus Dumbledore,"Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on."
Albus Dumbledore,All right. It'll be all right.
FUDGE,The execution shall dispatch...
Harry Potter,What?
Hermione Granger,I thought I just saw...Never mind.
Ron Weasley,Let's go!
Rubeus Hagrid,Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.
Harry Potter,"Oh, no."
Ron Weasley,He bit me. Scabbers.
Hermione Granger,Ron. Ron!
Harry Potter,Ron!
Ron Weasley,"Scabbers, come back."
Harry Potter,Wait!
Ron Weasley,"Scabbers, you bit me!"
Hermione Granger,"Harry, you do realize what tree this is?"
Harry Potter,"That's not good. Ron, run!"
Ron Weasley,"Harry, Hermione, run!"
Ron Weasley,It's the Grim!
Ron Weasley,Ah! Harry!
Harry Potter,"Ron! Ron, wait!"
Ron Weasley,Harry!Help!
Hermione Granger,Ron!!
Harry Potter,Ron!
Harry Potter,Ron. Ron.
Hermione Granger,Ron!
Harry Potter,Come on!
Harry Potter,Move!
Hermione Granger,Duck!
Hermione Granger,Harry!
Hermione Granger,"Oh, I'm sorry."
Harry Potter,Don't worry.
Hermione Granger,Where do you suppose this goes?
Harry Potter,I have a hunch.
Harry Potter,I just hope I'm wrong.
Hermione Granger,"We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?"
Harry Potter,Come on.
Harry Potter,Ron.
Hermione Granger,Ron. You're okay.
Harry Potter,The dog. Where is it?
Ron Weasley,It's a trap. He's the dog.
Ron Weasley,He's an Animagus.
Hermione Granger,"If you want to kill Harry, you have to kill us too!"
SIRIUS,No. Only one will die tonight.
Harry Potter,Then it'll be you!
SIRIUS,"Are you going to kill me, Harry?"
LUPIN,Expelliarmus!
LUPIN,"Well, well, Sirius."
LUPIN,"Looking rather ragged, aren't we?"
LUPIN,"Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within."
SIRIUS,"Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you Remus?"
SIRIUS,I found him.
LUPIN,I know.
SIRIUS,It's him.
LUPIN,I understand.
SIRIUS,Let's kill him!
Hermione Granger,No! I trusted you!
Hermione Granger,"And all this time, you've been his friend."
Hermione Granger,He's a werewolf!
Hermione Granger,That's why he's been missing classes.
LUPIN,How long have you known?
Hermione Granger,Since Professor Snape set the essay.
LUPIN,"Well, Hermione."
LUPIN,You are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met.
SIRIUS,"Enough talk, Remus!"
SIRIUS,"Come on, let's kill him!"
LUPIN,Wait!
SIRIUS,I did my waiting!
SIRIUS,Twelve years of it! In Azkaban!
LUPIN,Very well. Kill him.
LUPIN,But wait one more minute.
LUPIN,Harry has the right to know why.
Harry Potter,I know why.
Harry Potter,You betrayed my parents.
Harry Potter,You're the reason they're dead!
LUPIN,"No, it wasn't him."
LUPIN,"Somebody did betray your parents somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!"
Harry Potter,"Who was it, then?"
SIRIUS,Peter Pettigrew!
SIRIUS,And he's in this room! Right now!
SIRIUS,"Come out, come out, Peter!"
SIRIUS,"Come out, come out and play!"
Severus Snape,Expelliarmus!
Severus Snape,Vengeance is sweet.
Severus Snape,How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
LUPIN,Severus...
Severus Snape,I told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle. Here's the proof.
SIRIUS,"Brilliant, Snape."
SIRIUS,Once again you've put your keen mind to the task and come to the wrong conclusion.
SIRIUS,"If you'll excuse us, Remus and I have business to attend to."
Severus Snape,Give me a reason. I beg you!
LUPIN,Severus don't be a fool.
SIRIUS,He can't help it. It's habit.
LUPIN,Sirius be quiet.
SIRIUS,Be quiet yourself!
Severus Snape,"You two, quarrelling like an old married couple."
SIRIUS,Why don't you run along and play with your chemistry set!
Severus Snape,"I could do it, you know."
Severus Snape,But why deny the dementors?
Severus Snape,They're so longing to see you.
Severus Snape,Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Severus Snape,"Oh, yes. A Dementor's Kiss. One can only imagine what that must be like."
Severus Snape,"It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best."
LUPIN,"Severus, please."
Severus Snape,After you.
Harry Potter,Expelliarmus!
Ron Weasley,Harry! What did you just do?
Hermione Granger,You attacked a teacher!
Harry Potter,Tell me about Peter.
LUPIN,He was at school with us.
LUPIN,We thought he was our friend!
Harry Potter,No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
LUPIN,"No, he didn't."
LUPIN,"I thought so too, until you mentioned Pettigrew on the map!"
Harry Potter,"The map was lying, then."
SIRIUS,The map never lies!
SIRIUS,Pettigrew's alive!
SIRIUS,And he's right there!
Ron Weasley,Me?! He's mental!
SIRIUS,Not you! Your rat!
Ron Weasley,Scabbers has been in my family for...
SIRIUS,Twelve years?
SIRIUS,Curiously long life for a common garden rat!
SIRIUS,"He's missing a toe, isn't he?"
Ron Weasley,So what?
Harry Potter,All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
SIRIUS,Finger!
SIRIUS,Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead!
SIRIUS,And then he transformed into a rat!
Harry Potter,Show me.
Harry Potter,"Give it to him, Ron."
Ron Weasley,What are you trying to do to him?
Ron Weasley,Scabbers!
Ron Weasley,Leave him alone! Get off him!
Ron Weasley,What are you doing?
PETTIGREW,Remus? Sirius. My old friends!
PETTIGREW,Harry! Look at you.
PETTIGREW,You look so much like your father.
PETTIGREW,James. We were the best of friends...
SIRIUS,How dare you speak to Harry!
SIRIUS,How dare you talk about James in front of him!
LUPIN,You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
PETTIGREW,I didn't mean to!
PETTIGREW,The Dark Lord. You have no idea the weapons he possesses!
PETTIGREW,"Ask yourself, Sirius!"
PETTIGREW,What would you have done?
PETTIGREW,What would you have done?
SIRIUS,"I'm gonna died, I'm gonna die rather than betray my friends!"
PETTIGREW,James wouldn't have wanted me killed!
PETTIGREW,Your dad would have spared me!
PETTIGREW,He would have shown me mercy!
SIRIUS,"Should have realized if Voldemort didn't kill you, we would. Together!"
Harry Potter,No!
LUPIN,"Harry, this man..."
Harry Potter,I know what he is.
Harry Potter,But we'll take him to the castle.
PETTIGREW,"Bless you, boy. Bless you!"
Harry Potter,Get off!
Harry Potter,I said we'd take you to the castle.
Harry Potter,"After that, the dementors can have you."
SIRIUS,Sorry about the bite.
SIRIUS,I reckon that twinges a bit.
Ron Weasley,A bit? A bit?
Ron Weasley,You almost tore my leg off!
SIRIUS,I was going for the rat.
SIRIUS,"Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog."
SIRIUS,"More than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent."
SIRIUS,The tail I could live with.
SIRIUS,"But the fleas, they're murder."
Harry Potter,Okay.
Ron Weasley,You better go.
Harry Potter,"No. Don't worry, okay?"
Harry Potter,It's fine. I'll stay.
Hermione Granger,"You go, I'll stay."
Harry Potter,You okay?
Ron Weasley,I'm fine. Go.
Hermione Granger,That looks really painful.
Ron Weasley,So painful.
Ron Weasley,They might chop it.
Hermione Granger,I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.
Ron Weasley,It's too late. It's ruined.
Ron Weasley,It'll have to be chopped off.
SIRIUS,"It's beautiful, isn't it?"
SIRIUS,I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors.
SIRIUS,It'll be nice to do it again as a free man.
SIRIUS,That was a noble thing you did back there.
SIRIUS,He doesn't deserve it.
Harry Potter,I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends to become killers.
Harry Potter,"Besides, dead, the truth dies with him."
Harry Potter,"Alive, you're free."
PETTIGREW,Turn me into a flobberworm.
PETTIGREW,Anything but the dementors!
PETTIGREW,Ron! Haven't I been a good pet?
PETTIGREW,"You won't let them give me to the dementors, will you?"
PETTIGREW,I was your rat!
PETTIGREW,"Sweet, clever girl! Surely you won't..."
LUPIN,Get away from her!
SIRIUS,"I don't know if you know, Harry but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather."
Harry Potter,I know.
SIRIUS,I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle but if you ever wanted a different home...
Harry Potter,What? Come and live with you?
SIRIUS,It's just a thought.
SIRIUS,I can understand if you don't want to.
Hermione Granger,Harry!
SIRIUS,"Remus, my old friend."
SIRIUS,Have you taken your potion tonight?
SIRIUS,"You know the man you truly are, Remus!"
SIRIUS,This heart is where you truly live! Here!
SIRIUS,This flesh is only flesh!
Harry Potter,Expelliarmus!
Hermione Granger,Harry!
SIRIUS,Remus! Remus!
SIRIUS,Run! Run!
Harry Potter,Come on.
Hermione Granger,Wait. Wait.
Ron Weasley,Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.
Hermione Granger,Professor? Professor Lupin?
Ron Weasley,Nice doggy. Nice doggy!
Severus Snape,"There you are, Potter!"
Harry Potter,Sirius!
Severus Snape,"Come back here, Potter!"
Harry Potter,Sirius!
Harry Potter,No. Sirius!
Harry Potter,Expecto Patronum!
Hermione Granger,Harry?
Harry Potter,I saw my dad.
Hermione Granger,What?
Harry Potter,He sent the dementors away.
Harry Potter,I saw him across the lake.
Hermione Granger,"Listen Harry, they've captured Sirius."
Hermione Granger,Any minute the dementors are gonna perform the Kiss.
Harry Potter,They're gonna kill him?
Hermione Granger,No. It's worse.
Hermione Granger,Much worse.
Hermione Granger,They're going to suck out his soul.
Hermione Granger,"Headmaster, you've got to stop them."
Hermione Granger,They've got the wrong man.
Harry Potter,It's true sir. Sirius is innocent.
Ron Weasley,It's Scabbers who did it.
Albus Dumbledore,Scabbers?
Ron Weasley,"He's my rat, sir."
Ron Weasley,He's not really a rat. He was a rat.
Ron Weasley,He was my brother Percy's rat.
Ron Weasley,But then they gave him an owl...
Hermione Granger,"The point is, we know the truth."
Hermione Granger,Please believe us.
Albus Dumbledore,"I do, Miss Granger."
Albus Dumbledore,But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others.
Albus Dumbledore,"A child's voice, however honest and true is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen."
Albus Dumbledore,"Mysterious thing, time."
Albus Dumbledore,"Powerful and when meddled with, dangerous."
Albus Dumbledore,Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower.
Albus Dumbledore,"You know the laws, Miss Granger"
Albus Dumbledore,You must not be seen.
Albus Dumbledore,"And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime."
Albus Dumbledore,"If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss."
Albus Dumbledore,If you succeed tonight more than one innocent life may be spared.
Albus Dumbledore,"Three turns should do it, I think."
Albus Dumbledore,"Oh, and by the way."
Albus Dumbledore,"When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin."
Albus Dumbledore,Good luck.
Ron Weasley,What the bloody hell was that all about?
Hermione Granger,"Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk..."
Harry Potter,What just happened?
Harry Potter,Where's Ron?
Hermione Granger,07:30. Where were we at 7:30?
Harry Potter,I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?
Hermione Granger,Come on. And we can't be seen.
Harry Potter,Hermione!
Harry Potter,"Hermione! Hermione, wait."
Harry Potter,"Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?"
Draco Malfoy,Come to see the show?
Hermione Granger,"You! You foul, loathsome,evil little cockroach!"
Harry Potter,That's us.
Ron Weasley,"Hermione, no! He's not worth it."
Harry Potter,This is not normal.
Hermione Granger,"This is a Time-Turner, Harry."
Hermione Granger,McGonagall gave it to me first term.
Hermione Granger,This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.
Harry Potter,You mean we've gone back in time?
Hermione Granger,Yes.
Hermione Granger,Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment.
Hermione Granger,"Clearly, something happened he wants us to change."
Harry Potter,Good punch.
Hermione Granger,Thanks.
Hermione Granger,Malfoy's coming.
GOYLE,Run.
Draco Malfoy,"Not a word to anyone, understood?"
Draco Malfoy,I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood! Mark my words.
Hermione Granger,That felt good.
Ron Weasley,"Not good, brilliant."
Harry Potter,Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.
Harry Potter,Look. Buckbeak's still alive.
Hermione Granger,Of course.
Hermione Granger,Remember what Dumbledore said?
Hermione Granger,"If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared."
Hermione Granger,Let's go.
Harry Potter,Here they come. I'd better hurry.
Hermione Granger,Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him.
Hermione Granger,"Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free."
Ron Weasley,"Scabbers, you're alive!"
Rubeus Hagrid,Keep a closer eye on your pet.
Harry Potter,That's Pettigrew.
Hermione Granger,"Harry, you can't."
Harry Potter,Hermione that's the he betrayed my parents.
Harry Potter,You don't expect me to sit here.
Hermione Granger,"Yes, and you must!"
Hermione Granger,"Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now."
Hermione Granger,"If you go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad."
Hermione Granger,Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time Harry.
Hermione Granger,We can't be seen.
Hermione Granger,Fudge is coming.
Hermione Granger,And we aren't leaving?
Hermione Granger,Why aren't we leaving?
Harry Potter,Are you mad?
Harry Potter,That hurt.
Hermione Granger,Sorry.
Hermione Granger,We're coming out the back door. Go!
Hermione Granger,Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
Harry Potter,What?
Hermione Granger,I thought I just sawâ€¦ Never mind.
Ron Weasley,Let's go.
Hermione Granger,"Okay, go, Harry. Go!"
Harry Potter,Get away. Get off.
Albus Dumbledore,"Minister, I really think I should sign as well."
FUDGE,"Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be..."
Harry Potter,"Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly. "
Harry Potter,Come with us now. Come on.
Hermione Granger,Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.
Harry Potter,Buckbeak. Okay?
Harry Potter,Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?
FUDGE,Your name only.
Albus Dumbledore,It's such a very long name...
Harry Potter,"Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?"
Hermione Granger,"Come on. Come on, Buckbeak."
Hermione Granger,Come and get the nice dead ferret.
Hermione Granger,"Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky."
Albus Dumbledore,"Here we are, minister. Follow me."
Albus Dumbledore,"Now, look there."
FUDGE,Where?
Albus Dumbledore,Look beyond the rocks.
FUDGE,What am I supposed to see?
Albus Dumbledore,Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.
FUDGE,"Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed."
Albus Dumbledore,And all the strawberries.
Hermione Granger,"Come on, Buckbeak. Come on."
FUDGE,I see no strawberries.
Albus Dumbledore,Over there.
FUDGE,Where?
Albus Dumbledore,Over there.
Harry Potter,This way.
FUDGE,"Let's get this over, please."
Albus Dumbledore,All right.
FUDGE,But where is it?
FUDGE,"I saw the beast, just now."
FUDGE,Not a moment ago!
Albus Dumbledore,How extraordinary.
Rubeus Hagrid,Buckbeak.
FUDGE,"Come now, Dumbledore."
FUDGE,Someone's obviously released him.
FUDGE,Hagrid?
Hermione Granger,Buckbeak.
Albus Dumbledore,I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this.
Albus Dumbledore,"Afterall, How could you?"
Albus Dumbledore,You've been with us all the time.
Rubeus Hagrid,Right.
FUDGE,"Well, well."
FUDGE,We must search the grounds.
Albus Dumbledore,"Well, search the skies, if you must, minister."
Albus Dumbledore,"Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy."
Albus Dumbledore,"Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required."
Albus Dumbledore,Thank you.
Rubeus Hagrid,"You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor."
Hermione Granger,Come on.
Harry Potter,This way.
Harry Potter,"This way, now."
Harry Potter,Now what?
Hermione Granger,We save Sirius.
Harry Potter,How?
Hermione Granger,No idea.
Hermione Granger,Look. It's Lupin.
LUPIN,Immobulus!
Hermione Granger,And Snape's coming.
Harry Potter,And now we wait.
Hermione Granger,And now we wait.
Hermione Granger,At least someone's enjoying himself.
Harry Potter,Yeah.
Harry Potter,Hermione?
Hermione Granger,Yeah?
Harry Potter,"Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius I did see someone."
Harry Potter,That someone made the dementors go away.
Hermione Granger,With a Patronus.
Hermione Granger,I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.
Hermione Granger,According to him only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
Harry Potter,It was my dad.
Harry Potter,It was my dad conjured the Patronus.
Hermione Granger,"Harry, but your dad's..."
Harry Potter,Dead. I know.
Harry Potter,I'm just telling you what I saw.
Hermione Granger,Here we come.
Harry Potter,You see Sirius talking to me there?
Harry Potter,He's asking me to come live with him.
Hermione Granger,That's great.
Harry Potter,"When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'."
Harry Potter,It'll just be me and him.
Harry Potter,We could live in the country someplace you can see the sky.
Harry Potter,He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.
Hermione Granger,Harry!
SIRIUS,Run! Run!
Harry Potter,Let's go.
Harry Potter,What are you doing?
Hermione Granger,Saving your life.
Harry Potter,Thanks.
Harry Potter,Great. Now he's coming for us.
Hermione Granger,"Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!"
Hermione Granger,That was so scary.
Harry Potter,Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night.
Harry Potter,Sirius. Come on!
Hermione Granger,This is horrible.
Harry Potter,Don't worry.
Harry Potter,My dad will come.
Harry Potter,He'll conjure the Patronus.
Harry Potter,Any minute now.
Harry Potter,Right there. You'll see.
Hermione Granger,"Harry, listen to me."
Hermione Granger,No one's coming.
Harry Potter,"Don't worry, he will."
Harry Potter,He will come.
Harry Potter,Sirius.
Hermione Granger,You're dying both of you.
Hermione Granger,Harry!
Harry Potter,Expecto Patronum!
Harry Potter,"You were right, Hermione."
Harry Potter,It wasn't my dad I saw earlier. It was me!
Harry Potter,I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.
Harry Potter,"I knew I could do it this time because well, I had already done it."
Harry Potter,Does that make sense?
Hermione Granger,No. But I don't like flying...!
Hermione Granger,Bombarda!
SIRIUS,I'll be forever grateful for this to both of you.
Harry Potter,I want to go with you.
SIRIUS,"One day, perhaps."
SIRIUS,"For some time, my life will be too unpredictable."
SIRIUS,And besides you're meant to be here.
Harry Potter,But you're innocent.
SIRIUS,And you know it.
SIRIUS,"And for now, that will do."
SIRIUS,I expect you're tired of hearing this but you look so like your father.
SIRIUS,Except your eyes. You have...
Harry Potter,My mother's eyes.
SIRIUS,"It's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little."
SIRIUS,But know this: The ones that love us never really leave us.
SIRIUS,And you can always find them in here.
SIRIUS,You really are the brightest witch of your age.
Hermione Granger,We have to go.
Albus Dumbledore,Well?
Harry Potter,He's free. We did it.
Albus Dumbledore,Did what?
Albus Dumbledore,Good night.
Ron Weasley,How did you get there?
Ron Weasley,I was talking to you there.
Ron Weasley,And now you're there.
Hermione Granger,"What's he talking about, Harry?"
Harry Potter,I don't know.
Harry Potter,"Honestly, Ron. How can somebody be in two places at once?"
LUPIN,"Hello, Harry."
LUPIN,I saw you coming.
LUPIN,"I've looked worse, believe me."
Harry Potter,You've been sacked.
LUPIN,"No. No. I resigned, actually."
Harry Potter,Resigned? Why?
LUPIN,"Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition."
LUPIN,"This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want well, someone like me teaching their children."
Harry Potter,But Dumbledore...
LUPIN,Dumbledore has already risked enough on my behalf.
LUPIN,"Besides, people like me are..."
LUPIN,"Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now."
LUPIN,"Why do you look so miserable, Harry?"
Harry Potter,None of it made any difference.
Harry Potter,Pettigrew escaped.
LUPIN,Didn't make any difference?
LUPIN,"Harry, It made all the difference in the world."
LUPIN,You uncovered the truth.
LUPIN,You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.
LUPIN,It made a great deal of difference.
LUPIN,If I am proud of anything it is of how much you have learned this year.
LUPIN,"Now, since I am no longer your teacher I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you."
LUPIN,"So now I'll say goodbye, Harry."
LUPIN,I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.
LUPIN,Until then mischief managed.
Ron Weasley,"Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle."
NEVILLE,Harry.
NEVILLE,Wherever did you get it?
SEAMUS,"Can I have a go, Harry?"
SEAMUS,"After you, of course."
Harry Potter,What are you talking about?
Ron Weasley,Quiet.
Ron Weasley,Let the man through.
Ron Weasley,"I didn't mean to open it, Harry."
Ron Weasley,It was badly wrapped.
Ron Weasley,They made me do it.
FRED & GEORGE,Did not.
GEORGE,It's a Firebolt.
FRED,It's the fastest broom in the world.
Harry Potter,For me?
Harry Potter,But who sent it?
Ron Weasley,No one knows.
Hermione Granger,This came with it.
BOY 1,"Go on, Harry!"
BOY 2,"Yeah, let's see."
Hermione Granger,"How fast is it, Harry?"
Harry Potter,Lumos.
Harry Potter,I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
Harry Potter,Mischief managed.
Harry Potter,Nox.
